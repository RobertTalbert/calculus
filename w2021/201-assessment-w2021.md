# MTH 201 W2021 Assessment plan

## Third look 2020-12-28

Assessments: 

- Learning Targets, assessed primarily through Checkpoints but students can also do video, oral assessments, or make-your-own (*put limitations and deadlines on the alternatives*) 
	- Provide acceptable evidence of skill on a LT once: "Proficiency"
	- Provide acceptable evidence of skill on a LT twice: "Mastery"
	- 16 LT's in all, 6 core. 
	- No penalty for doing work that does not meet grading standard. BUT, only Mastery counts. 
- AEPs (should be 8-10 of these in all) 
- WeBWorK (16 questions per module -- 4 review, 6 each for A/B) 
- Daily Prep (two per module -- once for each A/B) 

Quantities: 16 learning targets (6 core), 8-10 AEPs, 



## Second look 2020-12-22 08:46:31

Assessments for learning: 

- WeBWorK (purpose: Basic practice and wax-on/wax-off repetition). Graded on points, infinite redo until deadline, stick to 16 problems per week model (so I can reuse sets) 
- Daily Prep (purpose: engagement + flipped class prep). Graded Completed/Incomplete. Expect 24 of these. No revisions possible but can spend tokens to fill in Incompletes. 
- Learning Targets (purpose: practice and mastery on core skills). 
  - 16 of these, 6 considered Core. 
  - Students earn levels on these -- Proficiency or Mastery (or Level 0-2). Level up each time you demonstrate acceptable evidence of skill. 
  - Level up can be accomplished through Checkpoint problems; oral assessments; videos; or student-initiated other means ("make me an offer"). 
  - Do acceptable work once: Level 1. Do it twice: Level 2. 
  - Checkpoints are every other week except there will be one during last week of classes and a last one during finals week. 
  - Alternative methods can be done at any time, up to two Learning Targets per week. Instructions and grading criteria posted on Blackboard. 
- AEP's (purpose: extension and application of the basics)
  - There will be between 8-10 of these posted through the semester. You DO NOT have to do all of them, only the ones that interest you and enough to satisfy grade requirements. 
  - Each one graded EMPX -- there are general standing requirements plus specific requirements for each one. 
  - Grades of P or X need revision in order to count. Can submit two items per week, three with a token. 
  - Revisions also limited by: Each AEP has an expiration date past which *any* revision costs a token. Revisions of "X" grades *always* cost a token. Also each revision must include a reflection on the reason for the revision plus a manifest of improvements made. 
  - Deadlines in final week: Submissions give by 11:59pm on 4/21 will be graded by Friday; after that point, no guarantees. All submissions due by 11:59pm Sunday 4/25. And keep the two-per-week rule. 



## Sticking with the 3D approach

- Basic skills: Assessed through Learning Target checkpoints and WeBWorK practice sets 
- Applications: POTW/AEP and some WeBWorK 
- Engagement: Daily Prep 

## Basic skill assessments

+ **Checkpoints**: Give about 10 of these through the semester. Try to avoid these during finals week. 
  + Similar to F2020. Alternatives include scheduling oral assessment and doing a Flipgrid video. Also open to other means at student request. 
  + Schedule -- About 10 total, last one during the last week of classes. **NOT TWO.** That was way too much to do during that last week. Special optional Checkpoint during finals week, problems by request and it costs a token (spend one token, request up to five Learning Targets). 
  + Redoing of Checkpoints: When a Learning Target is introduced on a Checkpoint, it's on there for that CHeckpoint and for the next TWO (three?). After that, only appears by request and costs a token. It's better at that point to do an oral exam or video. If done without a token, it's ignored. During last week of classes, Checkpoint will be all-inclusive. 
+ **WeBWorK**: Use exact same sets as Fall 2020. So 16 points per week. With 12 active weeks, 192 points minimum. 


## Applications

Decided to keep AEPs. But changes: 

- Give explicit training on tools for writing up mathematical work. 
- No lazy AEPs by just giving out uncovered sections. 
- Standard rules for earning grades (EMPX) 
- Update the template for these 
- Limit revisions: Two free revisions allowed. Must include a reflection on the mistake. All further revisions cost one token. Each AEP has an expiration date past which *any* revision costs a token. Revisions of "X" grades *always* cost a token. Deadlines in final week: Submissions give by 11:59pm on 4/21 will be graded by Friday; after that point, no guarantees. All submissions due by 11:59pm Sunday 4/25. And keep the two-per-week rule. 


## Daily Prep 

Still 24 of these, pretty much the same deal as Fall 2020 but perhaps incluse some FlipGrid stuff.
