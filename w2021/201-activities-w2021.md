# MTH 201 W2021 Activities 

## What we do before class 

- Daily Prep assignments: Use combo of Classkick and Desmos Activities as needed. 
- Daily Prep is a combo of video watching, doing exercises, recording questions and things you notice -- coming in prepared for the class work 
- **This is lower 1/3 of Bloom stuff** 


## What we do in class

- **Middle 1/3 of Bloom**: Analyze/apply -- Execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate, interpret, operate, sketch; differentiate, organize, relate, compare, contrast, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test
- So taking the basics up to a different level. 
- **Trust your pre-class activities** -- Don't just assume they have to be redone. 
- Not so much lecture. Or if it's GRR, make it clear this is what's going to happen and what the timeline will be for release of responsibility. 
- Most modules take two days. 
  - Day 1: Introduction of the main themes, initial applications and questions -- storytelling? 
  - Day 2: Deeper applications and analysis 
- Aim for the 10 + 30 + 10 model --- 10 minutes of review work and questions; 30 minutes of active work (broken up if needed); 10 minutes of wrap up and response --- introduce Google Form for replies 
- We **do not** do announcements in class. This is what Campuswire is for. 
- We also **do not** focus on lecture in class. This is what the Daily Prep is for. 


## What we do after class

- Continued work: WW, AEP, practice on LTs 
- Prep for next module 
- QUESTIONS 
- Think about: 
  - Some kind of writers' workshop on Campuswire except for Calculus problems 
  - Weekly reflections on FlipGrid 

Questions for weekly reflection: 

- What am I to learn this week? (completed prior to the activities)
- What did I learn this week?
- How well did I learn it?
- Is there anything that I still need to know, or know better—and if so, how will I seek the help I need to do that?
- What worked well—or not so well—in my approach to studying course material or preparing my assignments this week?
- What have I learned about my own study skills this week, and what will I do better in the future?
