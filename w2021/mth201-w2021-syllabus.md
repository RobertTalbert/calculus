# MTH 201-04: Calculus, Winter 2021

## Start Here 

**Welcome to Calculus**! I'm Robert Talbert, Professor of Mathematics, and I am grateful that you are signed up for the course and am looking forward to working with you this semester. Before reading any further, here are some first things to know:

1.  **I want you to succeed**. Your intellectual growth is my primary priority and responsibility this semester. I am committed to working with you to help you learn, to make sure you're not just surviving but thriving in our class and having productive, positive experiences with fascinating ideas that lead to a lifetime of further learning in this subject.
2.  **Success doesn't come easy.**  "Success" means more than just good grades. It involves being challenged intellectually and being regularly pushed out of your comfort zone and not settling for less than your best work. It also takes active, intentional participation even when it's difficult to get motivated. And, the pandemic is making everything harder than it needs to be. Make no mistake, you'll be working  **hard**  in MTH 201.
3.  **But the struggle is normal and healthy.**  When you're exercising to get physically stronger, the most explosive growth happens at the moment that you are struggling the hardest and you might feel you can't go any further. The same is true for getting mentally stronger. Your earlier math courses might have been easy for you, and so for you, struggle feels like you're doing something wrong.  **This is not the case. Struggle is actually a sign you're doing things right.**
4.  **Every facet of this course is built to give you support when you are challenged, and every person in the course has your back.**  Throughout the semester, you will be challenged but also given a lot of support to help you rise to the challenge. I will be readily available to help in several channels; your classmates will be available for help through structured and informal support groups; and the GVSU Math Department provides free help through the Math Center. There are people there to help every step of the way.

I am really looking forward to working with you in this course. It won't be easy, but if we work together and stay focused, you'll learn an amazing amount and have a great experience.

## Key Information 

+ **Professor contact info**: The *preferred* method of contact is email at talbertr@gvsu.edu. For questions that anyone in the class might answer, please post to the class feed on **Campuswire** instead. You can also DM me on Campuswire. 
+ **Professor availability:** I check email and Campuswire regularly between the hours of 7:00am and 5:00pm on weekdays, and once on Saturday mornings; if you contact me during those hours and your message needs a reply, you can expect to receive one within a few hours, often sooner. *Outside of those hours, particularly on weekends, I am offline and not checking messages.* Please plan accordingly as you schedule your work.  
+ **Class meetings**: MTWR 2:00-2:50 online. Class sessions will be held on Zoom using the link https://gvsu-edu.zoom.us/j/94860437207?pwd=MzdYS3VoQUZkdWcxT3NKR0VCeEpxQT09 and passcode **342013**. You will need to sign in to Zoom to join the meetings. 
+ **Drop-in hours**: XXXXX  You do *not* need an appointment! 
+ **Textbook**: *Active Calculus* by Matt Boelkins (August 2020 version). This is available *free* online here: https://activecalculus.org/single/frontmatter.html  You can also download a PDF copy here: https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/books/18/  You do not need a print copy, but if you want one, you can order it here: http://amzn.to/38HQdIo (Note this is the 2018 version.) 
+ **Course materials**: All course files, the class calendar, class forms, and most graded assignments are housed on Blackboard (http://mybb.gvsu.edu). 
+ **Course announcements and communication**: Course announcements, discussion, and other communication will be housed on **Campuswire** (link). You will also be able to opt in to a service called **Remind** which allows me to push reminders to you via text message. 

### Basic expectations of students in MTH 201

It's not only possible to learn Calculus in an online setting, but many students find the experience superior to an in-person class. You can have that experience too, but it will require your making sure you abide by these basic rules of engagement. All students are expected to: 

+ **Check email and Campuswire once before each class and once after each class** for announcements and other communication. 
+ **Check the course calendar at least once every 1-2 days** to maintain awareness of due dates and other events. 
+ **Use the Course Grade Checklist to track your progress** toward your desired course grade, updating it at least once a week.   
+ During meetings, **leave your camera on and audio muted unless asking a question**. If leaving the camera on is an issue, please use a photo of yourself as an avatar when you mute your video. 
+ **Engage with other students and the professor actively during class meetings**. Find a place to work that is dedicated for working, and put away all distractors. 
+ When encountering an issue with mathematics, **do as much as you can to solve the problem yourself before asking a question about it**. When you do ask a question, be sure to state the problem clearly, describe what you've already tried, and summarize the results of your efforts. (If asking a question about WeBWorK, use the "Email the Professor" button.) 
+ **Communicate openly and regularly with me (Prof. Talbert)** --- I want to help, but I'm not a mind reader! 


## What is this class about? 

Often, we care not only about *how much* there is of a certain quantity but *how fast it is changing* at a given point in time. For example, right now we care about the number of Covid-19 cases in Michigan, but in some ways we care more about the rate at which those cases are going up or down. Those two pieces of information together --- the **amount** and the **rate of change** --- are needed to make real decisions. **Calculus is all about modeling and understanding change.** 

In this class, you'll learn how to make precise models of change, starting with simple visual ideas to eventually build up three major concepts: the **limit**, the **derivative**, and the **integral**, along with the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** that unifies all of these concepts. You'll use these ideas to build realistic models of changing quantities, and then analyze how they change and express your findings in words to an appropriate audience. 

**Official course description**: A development of the fundamental concepts of calculus using graphical, numerical, and analytical methods with algebraic and trigonometric functions of a single variable. Limits and continuity, derivatives, indefinite integrals, definite integrals, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus; applications of derivatives and integrals. Fulfills Foundations - Mathematical Sciences. Offered every semester. Prerequisites: MTH 122 and MTH 123; or MTH 124; or assignment through Grand Valley math placement.


## What will each class be like? 

Your work in the class will follow a pattern that will involve you **before**, **during**, and **after** our meetings:

- **BEFORE each class**: You'll complete a **Daily Prep** assignment in which you'll read parts of the text, watch recorded lectures, and complete assignments that will get you up to speed on the basic ideas of new material. 
- **DURING each class**: Class time is reserved for *doing math*, together and individually. We will focus on activities that **apply the basics** that you learn in Daily Prep and get you ready for more advanced work later. 
- **AFTER each class**: You'll apply and extend the ideas we practice during class through different kinds of graded work. 

Two things that we **will not** do during class meetings are **listen to lectures** and **take tests**. Lectures during class periods will be infrequent, short, and targeted on specific questions; otherwise you'll be responsible for watching and taking notes on lectures during your Daily Prep activities (which are pre-recorded so you can watch and re-watch them at your own pace). And you heard right: **there are no timed quizzes or tests that take place during our class meetings**. All assignments, as described next, are done outside of class. 

## What assignments will there be? 

The course is split up into 12 **modules**, each with an "A" part and a "B" part. Typically, a module runs for four class days with each part receiving 2 days of class coverage. Most assignments are tied to these modules. 

- **Daily Prep** (2 per module, for a total of 24): Daily reading and videos, with exercises and questions to be submitted prior to class. These will help you learn the basics of new material and prepare you for more application-focused work in class. They are graded on the basis of completeness and effort only. 
- **WeBWorK** (16 questions per module, for a total of 192): Online homework assignments to help build your computational skills. Each set typically consists of 6 questions for Part A of a module, 6 questions for Part B, and 4 review questions from earlier modules. *You can resubmit most WeBWorK questions until they are fully correct.*
- **Checkpoints** (Appx. every 2 weeks): Checkpoints are do-at-home exams that provide chances to demonstrate skill with the 16 *Learning Targets* of the course (explained below).  
- **Application/Extension Problems (AEPs)** (between 8-10 planned): AEPs are extended problem sets where you will either *apply* basic content to real-life problems or explore *extensions* of those concepts beyond what's in the textbook. 

Checkpoints and AEPs will be posted to Blackboard, and you'll submit your work as an electronic file to Blackboard for grading; we'll practice the workflow for this during the first week of classes. Daily Prep assignments will be posted to Blackboard but submitted through different electronic means that will be made clear on each assignment. WeBWorK is *not* on Blackboard but on its own separate website: https://webwork-math.gvsu.edu/webwork2/MTH201-04/. 

There is also a final exam for the course which will focus on big-picture questions and reflections on your experiences in the course. The final exam will be assigned on Wednesday April 28 and will be due on Thursday April 29. 

## How are these assignments graded? 

Unlike most courses, **there are no points or percentages in this class**, except for WeBWorK questions. Instead, all grades are based on **whether your work meets clearly stated standards for acceptability**. If you work meets the standard, you will receive full credit for it. If not, then you will be given **instructive feedback** on what was missing, and you can then **revise and resubmit your work** for regrading. In this way, **you are not penalized for making mistakes as long as you *eventually* understand each topic.**. 

The marks for each kind of assignment and how those are earned are below: 

- **Daily Prep**: These are marked either **Pass** or **No Pass**. A "Pass" is awarded if every item on the assigment has a response that represents a good-faith effort to be right, and if it is submitted prior to the deadline. A "No Pass" is awarded otherwise, for example if an item is left blank (even accidentally), or an item has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if it's late. 
- **WeBWorK**: Most problems on WeBWorK sets are worth 1 point each; some offer partial credit. The point is awarded if the answer is correct. 
- **Checkpoints**: Checkpoints contain one problem (often with multiple parts) per Learning Target being assessed. Each of those problems is marked **Pass** or **No Pass**. The criteria for a "Pass" are found in the document titled "Information for Checkpoints" found on Blackboard in the *Syllabus* area. Generally speaking: A "Pass" is given if your work on the problem has no significant errors or omissions in computation, reasoning, or communication related to the Learning Target and no more than one "simple error" (an error unrelated to the Learning Target). 
- **AEPs**: These are marked **Excellent** (E), **Meets Expectations** (M), **Progressing** (P), or **Not assessable** (X): 

![EMPX rubric](https://i.ibb.co/0sRwsd6/EMPX-rubric-2021.png)

 ### Proficiency and Mastery on Learning Targets 

Each of the 16 Learning Targets in the course has a *rating* that indicates the level of skill you've demonstrated on that Target. There are three levels of ratings on each target: 

- **No Rating**: This means that you have *not yet demonstrated acceptable evidence of skill* on the Learning Target. Everyone starts off the semester with "No Rating" on all 16 targets. 
- **Proficiency**: This means that you have demonstrated ***one** item of acceptable evidence of skill* on the Learning Target. 
- **Mastery**: This means that you have demonstrated ***two** items of acceptable evidence of skill* on the Learning Target.

**What is an "item of acceptable evidence of skill"?** The following three things are conside

You can demonstrate acceptable evidence of skill on a Learning Target in three different ways: 

1. *By earning a "Pass" grade on a Checkpoint problem for that target*. Every time you complete a Checkpoint problem on a learning target successfully, you "level up" on that target. 
2. *Through a live oral assessment.* You can request an oral assessment with me (Prof. Talbert) on Zoom, where I give you a problem similar to a Checkpoint problem and you work it out live while I observe. If you do "Pass" quality work on it, you'll level up on that target. 
3. *Through making an instructional video.* You can also request to make a brief instructional video about a learning target, where I give you a problem similar to a Checkpoint problem and you work it out at a whitebaord while being recorded, and post it for the class to use. If you do "Pass" quality work on it, you'll level up on that target. 

While most students will just stick to Checkpoints, you are free to mix and match these methods on any Learning Target to suit your style and your needs. However, please see "Restrictions on Checkpoints" in the "What else do I need to know?" section below. 

## How do I earn a grade in the class? 

**In order to earn a C or higher in the course, you must first meet the following basic requirements:**

- **Earn a Pass mark on all three of the introductory assignments** at the beginning of the semester (Startup, Tools, and Precalculus Review); and  
- **Earn at least Proficiency rating on all six Core Learning Targets.** 

If these requirements are not met, then your grade will be capped at a C-. 

If you have met those requirements, then your semester grade in the course is determined by the following table. Your base grade (the letter A,B,C,D, or F without plus/minus) is the **highest** grade level for which **all** the requirements have been met or exceeded.

| Grade | Learning Targets with Mastery rating | AEP's completed with M or E | WeBWorK points | Daily Prep passed | 
| ----  | :------------------------:  | :----------------:  | :-------: | :----------: | 
| A | 15 *including all 6 Core* | 6 *including at least 3 E's* | 170 | 22 | 
| B | 13 | 5 | 150 | 20 | 
| C | 11 | 4 | 130 | 18 | 
| D | 5 | 2 | 100 | 12 | 

A grade of F is given if **none** of the rows has been fully completed. 

**Plus/minus grades:** You can earn "plus" and "minus" grades as follows: 

+ **Plus:** Meet all the requirements for a base grade and also the requirements for Learning Targets or AEP for the next level up; *and* pass the final. 
+ **Minus:** Meet all the requirements for a base grade *except for one* and that one is no more than one grade level lower; *or* not pass the final. 

## How do I revise and resubmit my work? 

- **Daily Prep** assignments may *not* be revised or resubmitted. They are graded on completeness and effort only and therefore can only be done once. 
- **WeBWorK** problems can be redone and resubmitted as many times as you need until the deadline. 
- **Checkpoints** are cumulative, and each Learning Target will appear for **four consecutive Checkpoints** before being "retired". For example Learning Target 3 appears on Checkpoints 2, 3, 4 and 5. Once a Learning Target has been retired, you may request a new instance of it on a Checkpoint by spending a token (below) or by waiting until Checkpoints 8 or 9 which will include all 16 targets.  **You are not penalized for doing work that doesn't meet the grading standard**; you can just try again on the next Checkpoint. However, you'll need to do Pass-quality work on two of the four available opportunities in order to receive a Mastery rating unless you use an alternative method (oral exam or video).  
- **AEPs** can be revised and resubmitted at any time just by revising your work based on the feedback you received, and then re-uploading to Blackboard. However, see "Restrictions on AEP revisions" in the "What else do I need to know?" section below. 


**Tokens:** Each student starts the semester with 5 tokens, which can be used to purchase exceptions to the course rules. The token "menu" is below. To spend a token, go to the *Token Spending* form that's linked in the sidebar on Blackboard, fill it out, and submit it. Once the form is submitted, the item you purchased is yours; you do not need permission or approval. 

| Item       | Cost | 
| ---------  | :----: | 
| Submit a third AEP in a given week | 1 | 
| Submit a revision of an AEP marked "X" | 1 | 
| Extend the deadline on a Checkpoint by 12 hours | 1 | 
| Extend the deadline on a WeBWorK set by 12 hours | 1 | 
| Convert a "No Pass" on a Daily Prep to a "Pass" | 1 | 
| Request a Checkpoint problem for a "retired" Learning Target | 1 | 

Tokens may not be "stacked"; for example you aren't allowed to spend 2 tokens and extend a deadline for 24 hours instead of 12. Deadline extensions must be requested prior to the original deadline and will be extended 12 hours from the original deadline (not from the time when the request was made). 





## What else do I need to know? 

### Definitions and polices on assignments 

**Definition of a "week":** A "week" for this course is defined to **begin at 12:01am on Monday and end at 11:59pm the following Sunday**. 


**Restrictions on AEP revisions:** 

+ The *Two-Per-Week* rule: **No more than two (2) AEP submissions can be made in any given week.** This can be two new submissions, two revisions, or one of each. A third submission in a week can be purchased with a token, but four or more submissions in a week are not allowed under any circumstance. 
+ Revisions of AEP's earning an "X": You must spend a token to revise an AEP that earned a grade of "X". 

**Restrictions on Checkpoints**: 

+ No more than two (2) Learning Targets per week may be assessed through oral exams or videos.  
+ To earn a Mastery rating on a Learning Target, you must do at least one Checkpoint problem or oral exam; you cannot earn Mastery through two videos. 


### Attendance, late work, and deadlines 

**Attendance:** You will need to participate actively in each class meeting to get the most out of the course and avoid having to teach yourself the material. Attendance will be taken but not graded; I will follow up with students with excessive absences, but no direct penalty is incurred. You do not need to seek permission to miss a class. However, realize that excessive absences will severely limit your ability to learn the subject. 

**Deadlines and late work:** Deadlines are generally strictly enforced, and late work will not be accepted. However, you can spend tokens to extend deadlines for Checkpoints and WeBWorK sets. Daily Prep deadlines cannot be extended, but you can spend a token to change a Daily Prep grade to Pass. 

**AEP deadlines:** You do not have to turn in all of the AEPs that are assigned --- just the ones that interest you, and only enough to satisfy the requirements for the course grade you want. AEPs generally do not have fixed deadlines; you are expected to work on these over time until your work meets expectations. However, note: 

- Every AEP has an *initial deadline* printed on the assigment. You must submit work on the AEP and earn a grade of "P" or higher by the initial deadline in order to revise it later. If you do, then you can revise the AEP on your own schedule throughout the semester without penalty. If you do not, the you can still submit the AEP later, but it will cost one token to do so and then one additional token for every revision thereafter. 
- No AEP submissions whatsoever, whether initial submissions or revisions, will be accepted after *11:59pm Eastern on Sunday April 25*. 
- Remember that *only two AEP items can be submitted per week*, so you can't procrastinate until the end and then submit several all at once. 


### Collaboration and academic honesty

I highly encourage you to collaborate with your classmates whenever collaboration is allowed. However, realize that *collaboration is not always allowed* and in all cases, there are limitations on how you can collaborate. In particular: 

- On **AEPs**, your work must represent *your own understanding* in *your own words*. You may not use solutions, directly or indirectly, from any sources --- including other students, past students, online sources, or other textbooks. 
- On **Checkpoints** (and Checkpoint alternatives), your work must still represent *your own understanding* in *your own words* and you may not use solutions, directly or indirectly, from other students. However, there is a list of approved external resources that you may use on Checkpoints, including [Wolfram|Alpha](http://wolframalpha.com), [Desmos](http://desmos.com), your textbook, and other items posted to Blackboard. That list is included in the document titled "Information for Checkpoints" found on Blackboard in the *Syllabus* area. **Items not on the approved list may be used only with prior permission from me (Talbert).** 
- On **all other assignments**, you may collaborate with others, but you must contribute significantly to the assignment, and your work must represent *your own understanding* in *your own words*.

You are responsible for understanding this policy and the [GVSU Student Code](https://www.gvsu.edu/policies/policy.htm?policyId=EFAB64E1-C25B-E1A3-CA2B08B0B821C774&search=). Violations will result, at minimum, in a mark of "X" or "No Pass" on the assignment. Serious or repeat violations of this policy will result in increasingly horrible consequences, including being barred from further submissions of the assignment or Learning Target, or even failure of the class. 



### Technology 

Being an online class, we will use a variety of technological tools to learn. 

- You *do not* need a graphing calculator, and we will not use them in the class, but it's OK if you have one. (We will use [Desmos](http://www.desmos.com), a free online graphing tool, instead of graphing calculators.)
- Instead, you *do need* a **laptop or tablet device** running a **modern web browser** (such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox) and **reliable access to high-speed internet**. 
- You also need an **active GVSU network account** so you can access email, Blackboard, and Google Docs. 
- Preferably, your device should have a **touchscreen** that allows **writing on the screen with a stylus**. If you don't have such a device, consider purchasing a [drawing pad](https://www.amazon.com/customerpicks/Explore-drawing-tablets-for-laptops/424f9b9ace2bfffcb82c) that connects your computer via USB; many are under $50. 
- The software tools we use in the course are all free and either web-based or available as apps on mutiple platforms. We will introduce and train on these in the first week of classes. 

If you encounter issues with technology, please use the appropriate source of help: 

+ *For help with Blackboard*: Email the Blackboard Help Desk at bbadmin@gvsu.edu or call (616) 331-8526. For hours of operation and more information see https://www.gvsu.edu/elearn/help/. 
+ *For help with the GVSU network, email, or printing*: Email the GVSU IT Help Desk at helpdesk@gvsu.edu; or call (616) 331-2101 or toll free (855) 435-7488. For hours of operation and more information see  https://www.gvsu.edu/it/. 
+ *For specific help with your computer*: Try the GVSU IT Help Desk (see previous bullet) or contact your equipment manufacturer or computer store. 
+ *For help with course tools such as Desmos and Campuswire*: Ask a question on the `#tech` channel on Campuswire, seek out the help documentation in the tool, or do a targeted Google search. 

Please note that **I (Prof. Talbert) am not able to provide student tech support** as I do not have access to your accounts or knowledge of your hardware. I can help with questions about course tools (Desmos, etc.) but please ask those questions on Campuswire so others can see and help too. 


### Getting help and support 

**Math Center:** GVSU’s Math Tutoring Center is online with Blackboard Collaborate this semester!  You can access virtual drop-in tutoring through the link in your Blackboard course called Math Tutoring Center or on our website at http://gvsu.edu/tutoring/math/.  Then you need to click on the "Online Math Tutoring Center" button, which will require a GVSU login.  There will be tutors online, ready to help, Monday through Thursday 11a – 9p, Friday 11a – 3p and Sunday 5p – 9p starting Wednesday, January 20th.  Bring questions about your calculator, on methods and concepts, or on specific problems.  All Math Center tutoring is FREE, so stop by early and often.  We ask that when you enter our Collaborate room, please type your first and last name so we can get you signed in and connected with a tutor. 

**Special learning needs:** If you have special needs because of learning, physical or other disabilities, it is your responsibility to contact Disability Support Resources (DSR) at 616-331-2490 or http://www.gvsu.edu/dsr/ . DSR will help you arrange accommodations.  Then, speak with me in person about making those accommodations and ensure that they are consistent with your arrangements with DSR.

**Basic needs security:** If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, I encourage you to visit [Replenish](https://www.gvsu.edu/replenish/), a food resource for GVSU students. If you are comfortable doing so, please speak with me about your circumstances so that I can advocate for you and to connect you with other campus resources. 

**Gender identity and expression:** If, for purposes of gender identity and expression, your official name (in Banner) does not match your preferred name, your name can be updated in Blackboard. Please contact the registrar's office to submit this request.  The registrar's office will contact the Blackboard administrator to make the change and will also contact your professors to inform them that your name in Banner will not match the name in Blackboard.

## Appendix: Learning Targets, Course Modules, and Checkpoint Schedule

There are **16 Learning Targets** in the course. **Six** (6) of those are designated as **Core** Learning Targets, because they are the most essential topics of the course, and demonstrating basic skill on these is required for a passing grade. All the Learning Targets are listed below, with the Core targets marked with **Core**. 

1. I can find the average rate of change of a function and the average velocity of an object on an interval.
2. (**CORE**) I can find one- and two-sided limits of a function at a point and at infinity using numerical, graphical, and algebraic methods.
3. I can find the derivative of a function (both at a point and as a function) and the instantaneous velocity of an object using the definition of the derivative.
4. (**CORE**) I can use derivative notation correctly, state the units of a derivative, estimate the value of a derivative using difference quotients, and correctly interpret the meaning of a derivative in context. 
5. Given information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$, I can correctly give information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$ and the increasing/decreasing behavior and concavity of $f$ (and vice versa).
6. (**CORE**) I can compute basic-level derivatives using algebraic shortcut methods and solve simple application problems. (Functions involved will include constant, power, polynomial, exponential, and sine/cosine functions; applications include rates of change and slopes/equations of tangent lines)
7. (**CORE**) I can compute derivatives involving the Product, Quotient, and Chain Rules. (Functions involved will be those under "basic")
8. I can compute advanced-level derivatives using algebraic shortcut methods. (Functions involved will include "basic" ones plus logarithmic, trig, and inverse trigonometric functions along with Product, Quotient, and Chain Rules and multiple rules in combination.) 
9. I can find the critical values of a function, determine where the function is increasing and decreasing, and apply the First and Second Derivative Tests to classify the critical points as local extrema.
10. I can determine the intervals of concavity of a function and find all of its points of inflection.
11. I can use the Extreme Value Theorem to find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a closed interval.
12. (**CORE**) I can set up and use derivatives to solve applied optimization problems.
13. I can calculate the area under a curve, net change, and displacement using geometric formulas and Riemann sums.
14. I can evaluate a definite integral using geometric formulas and the Properties of the Definite Integral.
15.  I can explain the meaning of each part of the definition of the definite integral in terms of a graph, and interpret the definite integral in terms of areas, net change, and displacement.
16. (**CORE**) I can find antiderivatives of a function and evaluate a definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
