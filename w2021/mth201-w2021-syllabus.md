# MTH 201-02 Course Syllabus Winter 2021

## Start Here 

**Welcome to Calculus**! I'm Robert Talbert, Professor of Mathematics, and I am grateful that you are signed up for the course and am looking forward to working with you this semester. Before reading any further, here are some first things to know:

1.  **I want you to succeed**. Your intellectual growth is my primary priority and responsibility this semester. I am committed to working with you to help you learn, to make sure you're not just surviving but thriving in our class and having productive, positive experiences with fascinating ideas that lead to a lifetime of further learning in this subject.
2.  **Success doesn't come easy.**  "Success" means more than just good grades. It involves being challenged intellectually and being regularly pushed out of your comfort zone and not settling for less than your best work. It also takes active, intentional participation even when it's difficult to get motivated. And, the pandemic is making everything harder than it needs to be. Make no mistake, you'll be working  **hard**  in MTH 201.
3.  **But the struggle is normal and healthy.**  When you're exercising to get physically stronger, the most explosive growth happens at the moment that you are struggling the hardest and you might feel you can't go any further. The same is true for getting mentally stronger. Your earlier math courses might have been easy for you, and so for you, struggle feels like you're doing something wrong.  **This is not the case. Struggle is actually a sign you're doing things right.**
4.  **Every facet of this course is built to give you support when you are challenged, and every person in the course has your back.**  Throughout the semester, you will be challenged but also given a lot of support to help you rise to the challenge. I will be readily available to help in several channels; your classmates will be available for help through structured and informal support groups; and the GVSU Math Department provides free help through the Math Center. There are people there to help every step of the way.

I am really looking forward to working with you in this course. It won't be easy, but if we work together and stay focused, you'll learn an amazing amount and have a great experience.

## Key Information 

+ **Professor contact info**: The *preferred* method of contact is email at talbertr@gvsu.edu. For questions that anyone in the class might answer, please post to the class feed on **Campuswire** instead. You can also DM me on Campuswire. 
+ **Class meetings**: MTWR 2:00-2:50 online. Class sessions will be held on Zoom using the link https://gvsu-edu.zoom.us/j/94860437207?pwd=MzdYS3VoQUZkdWcxT3NKR0VCeEpxQT09 and passcode **342013**. You will need to sign in to Zoom to join the meetings. 
+ **Drop-in hours**: XXXXX  You do *not* need an appointment! 
+ **Textbook**: *Active Calculus* by Matt Boelkins (August 2020 version). This is available *free* online here: https://activecalculus.org/single/frontmatter.html  You can also download a PDF copy here: https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/books/18/  You do not need a print copy, but if you want one, you can order it here: http://amzn.to/38HQdIo (Note this is the 2018 version.) 
+ **Course materials**: All course files, the class calendar, class forms, and most graded assignments are housed on Blackboard (http://mybb.gvsu.edu). 
+ **Course announcements and communication**: Course announcements, discussion, and other communication will be housed on **Campuswire** (link). You will also be able to opt in to a service called **Remind** which allows me to push reminders to you via text message. 

### Basic expectations of students in MTH 201

It's not only possible to learn Calculus in 

+ Check email and Campuswire once before each class and once after each class for announcements and other communication. 
+ Check the course calendar at least once every 1-2 days to maintain awareness of due dates and other events. 
+ Capture all actionable information from course communications into a personal calendar and notes system that you check at least once per day. 
+ Maintain updated personal records of your graded work, outside of Blackboard, so you can detect any data entry errors; and bring all such errors to my attention as soon as possible using the Grade Discrepancy Form.
+ Use the Course Grade Checklist to track your progress toward your desired course grade, updating it at least once a week.   
+ During meetings, leave your camera on and audio muted unless asking a question. If leaving the camera on is an issue, please use a photo of yourself as an avatar when you mute your video. 
+ Engage with other students and the professor actively during class meetings. Find a place to work that is dedicated for working, and put away all distractors. 
+ When encountering an issue with mathematics, do as much as you can to solve the problem yourself before asking a question about it. When you do ask a question, be sure to state the problem clearly, describe what you've already tried, and summarize the results of your efforts. (If asking a question about WeBWorK, use the "Email the Professor" button.) 
+ Bring all questions, concerns, and issues with the course to the professor --- engage in open communication.

## Appendix: Learning Targets

There are **16 Learning Targets** in the course. **Six** (6) of those are designated as **Core** Learning Targets, because they are the most essential topics of the course, and demonstrating basic skill on these is required for a passing grade. All the Learning Targets are listed below, with the Core targets marked with **Core**. 

1. I can find the average rate of change of a function and the average velocity of an object on an interval.
2. (**CORE**) I can find one- and two-sided limits of a function at a point and at infinity using numerical, graphical, and algebraic methods.
3. I can find the derivative of a function (both at a point and as a function) and the instantaneous velocity of an object using the definition of the derivative.
4. (**CORE**) I can use derivative notation correctly, state the units of a derivative, estimate the value of a derivative using difference quotients, and correctly interpret the meaning of a derivative in context. 
5. Given information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$, I can correctly give information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$ and the increasing/decreasing behavior and concavity of $f$ (and vice versa).
6. (**CORE**) I can compute basic-level derivatives using algebraic shortcut methods and solve simple application problems. (Functions involved will include constant, power, polynomial, exponential, and sine/cosine functions; applications include rates of change and slopes/equations of tangent lines)
7. (**CORE**) I can compute derivatives involving the Product, Quotient, and Chain Rules. (Functions involved will be those under "basic")
8. I can compute advanced-level derivatives using algebraic shortcut methods. (Functions involved will include "basic" ones plus logarithmic, trig, and inverse trigonometric functions along with Product, Quotient, and Chain Rules and multiple rules in combination.) 
9. I can find the critical values of a function, determine where the function is increasing and decreasing, and apply the First and Second Derivative Tests to classify the critical points as local extrema.
10. I can determine the intervals of concavity of a function and find all of its points of inflection.
11. I can use the Extreme Value Theorem to find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a closed interval.
12. (**CORE**) I can set up and use derivatives to solve applied optimization problems.
13. I can calculate the area under a curve, net change, and displacement using geometric formulas and Riemann sums.
14. I can evaluate a definite integral using geometric formulas and the Properties of the Definite Integral.
15.  I can explain the meaning of each part of the definition of the definite integral in terms of a graph, and interpret the definite integral in terms of areas, net change, and displacement.
16. (**CORE**) I can find antiderivatives of a function and evaluate a definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
