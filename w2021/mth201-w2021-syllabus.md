# MTH 201-04: Calculus, Winter 2021

## Start Here 

**Welcome to Calculus**! I'm Robert Talbert, Professor of Mathematics, and I am grateful that you are signed up for the course and am looking forward to working with you this semester. Before reading any further, here are some first things to know:

1.  **I want you to succeed**. Your intellectual growth is my primary priority and responsibility this semester. I am committed to working with you to help you learn, to make sure you're not just surviving but thriving in our class and having productive, positive experiences with fascinating ideas that lead to a lifetime of further learning in this subject.
2.  **Success doesn't come easy.**  "Success" means more than just good grades. It involves being challenged intellectually and being regularly pushed out of your comfort zone and not settling for less than your best work. It also takes active, intentional participation even when it's difficult to get motivated. And, the pandemic is making everything harder than it needs to be. Make no mistake, you'll be working  **hard**  in MTH 201.
3.  **But the struggle is normal and healthy.**  When you're exercising to get physically stronger, the most explosive growth happens at the moment that you are struggling the hardest and you might feel you can't go any further. The same is true for getting mentally stronger. Your earlier math courses might have been easy for you, and so for you, struggle feels like you're doing something wrong.  **This is not the case. Struggle is actually a sign you're doing things right.**
4.  **Every facet of this course is built to give you support when you are challenged, and every person in the course has your back.**  Throughout the semester, you will be challenged but also given a lot of support to help you rise to the challenge. I will be readily available to help in several channels; your classmates will be available for help through structured and informal support groups; and the GVSU Math Department provides free help through the Math Center. There are people there to help every step of the way.

I am really looking forward to working with you in this course. It won't be easy, but if we work together and stay focused, you'll learn an amazing amount and have a great experience.

### Basic expectations of students in MTH 201

It's not only possible to learn Calculus in an online setting, but many students find the experience superior to an in-person class. You can have that experience too, but it will require your making sure you abide by these basic rules of engagement. All students are expected to: 

+ **Check email and Campuswire once before each class and once after each class** for announcements and other communication. 
+ **Check the course calendar at least once every 1-2 days** to maintain awareness of due dates and other events. 
+ **Use the Course Grade Checklist to track your progress** toward your desired course grade, updating it at least once a week.   
+ During meetings, **leave your camera on and audio muted unless asking a question**. If leaving the camera on is an issue, please use a photo of yourself as an avatar when you mute your video. 
+ **Engage with other students and the professor actively during class meetings**. Find a place to work that is dedicated for working, and put away all distractors. 
+ When encountering an issue with mathematics, **do as much as you can to solve the problem yourself before asking a question about it**. When you do ask a question, be sure to state the problem clearly, describe what you've already tried, and summarize the results of your efforts. (If asking a question about WeBWorK, use the "Email the Professor" button.) 
+ **Communicate openly and regularly with me (Prof. Talbert)** --- I want to help, but I'm not a mind reader! 


## What is this class about? 

Often, we care not only about *how much* there is of a certain quantity but *how fast it is changing* at a given point in time. For example, right now we care about the number of Covid-19 cases in Michigan, but in some ways we care more about the rate at which those cases are going up or down. Those two pieces of information together --- the **amount** and the **rate of change** --- are needed to make real decisions. **Calculus is all about modeling and understanding change.** 

In this class, you'll learn how to make precise models of change, starting with simple visual ideas to eventually build up three major concepts: the **limit**, the **derivative**, and the **integral**, along with the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** that unifies all of these concepts. You'll use these ideas to build realistic models of changing quantities, and then analyze how they change and express your findings in words to an appropriate audience. 

**Official course description**: A development of the fundamental concepts of calculus using graphical, numerical, and analytical methods with algebraic and trigonometric functions of a single variable. Limits and continuity, derivatives, indefinite integrals, definite integrals, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus; applications of derivatives and integrals. Fulfills Foundations - Mathematical Sciences. Offered every semester. Prerequisites: MTH 122 and MTH 123; or MTH 124; or assignment through Grand Valley math placement.


## What will each class be like? 

Your work in the class will follow a pattern that will involve you **before**, **during**, and **after** our meetings:

- **BEFORE each class**: You'll complete a **Daily Prep** assignment in which you'll read parts of the text, watch recorded lectures, and complete assignments that will get you up to speed on the basic ideas of new material. 
- **DURING each class**: Class time is reserved for *doing math*, together and individually. We will focus on activities that **apply the basics** that you learn in Daily Prep and get you ready for more advanced work later. 
- **AFTER each class**: You'll apply and extend the ideas we practice during class through different kinds of graded work. 

Two things that we **will not** do during class meetings are **listen to lectures** and **take tests**. Lectures during class periods will be infrequent, short, and targeted on specific questions; otherwise you'll be responsible for watching and taking notes on lectures during your Daily Prep activities (which are pre-recorded so you can watch and re-watch them at your own pace). And you heard right: **there are no timed quizzes or tests that take place during our class meetings**. All assignments, as described next, are done outside of class. 

## What assignments will there be? 

The course is split up into 12 **modules**, each with an "A" part and a "B" part. Typically, a module runs for four class days with each part receiving 2 days of class coverage. Most assignments are tied to these modules. 

- **Daily Prep** (2 per module, for a total of 24): Daily reading and videos, with exercises and questions to be submitted prior to class. These will help you learn the basics of new material and prepare you for more application-focused work in class. They are graded on the basis of completeness and effort only. 
- **WeBWorK** (16 questions per module, for a total of 192): Online homework assignments to help build your computational skills. Each set typically consists of 6 questions for Part A of a module, 6 questions for Part B, and 4 review questions from earlier modules. *You can resubmit most WeBWorK questions until they are fully correct.*
- **Checkpoints** (Appx. every 2 weeks): There will be between 8 and 10 Checkpoints, which are do-at-home exams that provide chances to demonstrate skill with the 16 *Learning Targets* of the course (explained below). Every Checkpoint is cumulative (so Checkpoint 2 includes material from Checkpoint 1; Checkpoint 3 includes material from Checkpoints 1 and 2; etc.) 
- **Application/Extension Problems (AEPs)** (between 8-10 planned): AEPs are extended problem sets where you will either *apply* basic content to real-life problems or explore *extensions* of those concepts beyond what's in the textbook. 

Checkpoints and AEPs are posted to Blackboard, and you'll submit your work as an electronic file to Blackboard for grading; we'll practice the workflow for this during the first week of classes. Daily Prep assignments will be posted to Blackboard but submitted through different electronic means that will be made clear on each assignment. WeBWorK is *not* on Blackboard but on its own separate website: https://webwork-math.gvsu.edu/webwork2/MTH201-04/.

## Appendix: Learning Targets

There are **16 Learning Targets** in the course. **Six** (6) of those are designated as **Core** Learning Targets, because they are the most essential topics of the course, and demonstrating basic skill on these is required for a passing grade. All the Learning Targets are listed below, with the Core targets marked with **Core**. 

1. I can find the average rate of change of a function and the average velocity of an object on an interval.
2. (**CORE**) I can find one- and two-sided limits of a function at a point and at infinity using numerical, graphical, and algebraic methods.
3. I can find the derivative of a function (both at a point and as a function) and the instantaneous velocity of an object using the definition of the derivative.
4. (**CORE**) I can use derivative notation correctly, state the units of a derivative, estimate the value of a derivative using difference quotients, and correctly interpret the meaning of a derivative in context. 
5. Given information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$, I can correctly give information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$ and the increasing/decreasing behavior and concavity of $f$ (and vice versa).
6. (**CORE**) I can compute basic-level derivatives using algebraic shortcut methods and solve simple application problems. (Functions involved will include constant, power, polynomial, exponential, and sine/cosine functions; applications include rates of change and slopes/equations of tangent lines)
7. (**CORE**) I can compute derivatives involving the Product, Quotient, and Chain Rules. (Functions involved will be those under "basic")
8. I can compute advanced-level derivatives using algebraic shortcut methods. (Functions involved will include "basic" ones plus logarithmic, trig, and inverse trigonometric functions along with Product, Quotient, and Chain Rules and multiple rules in combination.) 
9. I can find the critical values of a function, determine where the function is increasing and decreasing, and apply the First and Second Derivative Tests to classify the critical points as local extrema.
10. I can determine the intervals of concavity of a function and find all of its points of inflection.
11. I can use the Extreme Value Theorem to find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a closed interval.
12. (**CORE**) I can set up and use derivatives to solve applied optimization problems.
13. I can calculate the area under a curve, net change, and displacement using geometric formulas and Riemann sums.
14. I can evaluate a definite integral using geometric formulas and the Properties of the Definite Integral.
15.  I can explain the meaning of each part of the definition of the definite integral in terms of a graph, and interpret the definite integral in terms of areas, net change, and displacement.
16. (**CORE**) I can find antiderivatives of a function and evaluate a definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
