# Start/Stop/Continue for Winter 2021 

## Overall notes 

- **SIMPLIFY**: Everything just seemed too complicated. Grading system, assessment plan, on and on. 
- **TOO MANY CHOICES**: I gave students too many options. Keep it limited and focused. 
- **AEPs must go**: Hated grading them, don't believe they accomplished their purpose -- I can do better with smaller and more frequent assignments that have LIMITED revisions. 
- Overall game plan for learning targets and topics was sound. Need to include one-sided limits and homemade materials about position/acceleration/velocity
- Also need to give explicit training on tools: Desmos (including activities), W|A, Spreadsheets. 
- Need to build social interaction more fully into the course -- fixed groups, specific roles/prompts/reports when doing group work --- also more intentional checkins
- Nudges and ongoing grade reports -- this will surface misconceptions about grades/syllabus better. Continually surprised in F2020 about what students will get wrong. 

**THEME: Calculus is about modeling and understanding change** 

**Threads:**

+ Building models and then analyzing how they change 
+ Communicating analysis to regular people 
+ Using data 




## START

- Ending each class with quick feedback (What's a good tool for this? Ongoing Google Form with a fixed URL?) 
- Add some form of backchannel for class meetings (Or just use Zoom chat) 
- Text message alert system 
- Nudge students to register with DSR early in the semester 
- Move all course communication to Campuswire. Use Bb only for "amber alert" emergency broadcasts. 
- Set up chat spaces for fixed groups 
- Limiting retakes of Learning Targets. Rather than anytime/anywhere: 
  - LTs rotate on/off Checkpoints at regular intervals 
  - Once rotated on, they remain on that CP plus the next three (total of four attempts). After that students have to request oral retakes or videos. 
  - Exception: Last week of classes and final exam will be all-hands Checkpoints. 
  - Need a more comprehensive document of standards. 
- Classkick: Use it but have organized login process during first week of classes 
- More generally a "tech day" during week 1: Get set up on Classkick, Desmos activities, Campuswire 
- Modules more finely grained -- so 20-24 of them instead of 12


### Replacing AEPs

AEPs will be replaced with "Problems of the Week"

- Collection of 3-4 problems each week of which students pick 2-3, with maybe one required one. 
- Each week there is also a tech-centric problem. Certiain number of these required for grades. (in lieu of labs)
- Graded simply Pass/No Pass with clear standards given in a separate document 
- Revisions: 
  - First two revisions are free
  - All further revisions cost one token 
  - No more than two revisions submitted per week
  - Expiration date: Revisions must be completed within four weeks or else it costs an additional token
  - Last week of classes: Two free revisions

So these would be turned in, then graded; if they don't meet the standard, they can be revised up to twice with no penalty as long as that's done before a certain date. After that date, or if there's a third revision, it costs a token. Except for the final week when every student will get two free revisions. 



## STOP

- AEP's (above)
- PE credits. 
- Use of "Proficiency" and "MAstery" -- call it "level 0", "1", "2"
- Weekend deadlines. Set up "week" to run Saturday-Friday and have deadlines on Friday. This is a nudge not to work on the weekends -- or to use it for early work.
- 

## CONTINUE

- Tools: Campuswire, Classkick, Jamboard, Desmos
- Use of Markdown files (but make a nice-looking syllabus) 
- Posting class links each class or start of module 
- Weekly guides with schedules 

## Changes to assessments

- Four basic things: Learning Targets (core + supplemental), POTW, WeBWorK, Daily Prep. 
- MAYBE one additional: "Startup Bundle" consisting of Precalculus Review WW + Tool setup. Failing to complete the Startup bundle by X/X/2021 will result in a one-letter grade penalty 
- Plus/minus system limited to Final Exam performance. State that if you meet all of the grade requirements except one, I'll look at it on a case-by-case basis (but no policies, no promises). 




## Questions 

- Do students have direct access to Zoom links, or do I need to post those? *2020-12-15 08:38:50*
