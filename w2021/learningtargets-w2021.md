# MTH 201 Learning Targets -- Winter 2021 revision

1. I can find the average rate of change of a function and the average velocity of an object on an interval.
2. **CORE** I can find one- and two-sided limits of a function at a point and at infinity using numerical, graphical, and algebraic methods.
3. I can find the derivative of a function (both at a point and as a function) and the instantaneous velocity of an object using the definition of the derivative.
4. **CORE** I can use derivative notation correctly, state the units of a derivative, estimate the value of a derivative using difference quotients, and correctly interpret the meaning of a derivative in context. 
5. Given information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$, I can correctly give information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$ and the increasing/decreasing behavior and concavity of $f$ (and vice versa).
6. **CORE** I can compute basic-level derivatives using algebraic shortcut methods and solve simple application problems. (Functions involved will include constant, power, polynomial, exponential, and sine/cosine functions; applications include rates of change and slopes/equations of tangent lines)
7. **CORE** I can compute derivatives involving the Product, Quotient, and Chain Rules. (Functions involved will be those under "basic")
8. I can compute advanced-level derivatives using algebraic shortcut methods. (Functions involved will include "basic" ones plus logarithmic, trig, and inverse trigonometric functions along with Product, Quotient, and Chain Rules and multiple rules in combination.) 
9. I can find the critical values of a function, determine where the function is increasing and decreasing, and apply the First and Second Derivative Tests to classify the critical points as local extrema.
10. I can determine the intervals of concavity of a function and find all of its points of inflection.
11. I can use the Extreme Value Theorem to find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a closed interval.
12. **CORE** I can set up and use derivatives to solve applied optimization problems.
13. I can calculate the area between curves, net change, and displacement using geometric formulas and Riemann sums.
14. I can explain the meaning of each part of the definition of the definite integral in terms of a graph, and interpret the definite integral in terms of areas, net change, and displacement.
15. I can evaluate a definite integral using geometric formulas and the Properties of the Definite Integral.
16. **CORE** I can find antiderivatives of a function and evaluate a definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

This gives 6 **CORE** targets. If I had to go to 8, I'd choose 2 from: 3, 5, 14. 

A: Level 2 on 12/16 including all Core; Level 1 on 3 others (15/16 total)
B: Level 2 on 10/16 including all Core; Level 1 on 4 others (14/16 total)
C: Level 2 on 8/16 including all Core; Level 1 on 5 others (13/16 total)
D: Level 1 on 8/16 including all Core 

## Big Picture objectives -- reserve for final exam 

- I can use computer tools to model and solve a problem in Calculus. 
- I can apply the concepts of Calculus to problems that are different from the ones found in the text, class notes, and examples. 
- I can communicate the setup and solution of a Calculus problem to a non-specialist, clearly and meaningfully in a well-structured and professional written document. 
- I can assess my own work and use feedback to improve it.
