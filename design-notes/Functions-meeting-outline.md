  + Sum, product, difference, quotients of functions
  + Composites of functions 
  + Basic structure 
  + Interval notation
  + Domain and range

  + Next meeting is WR of next week 
  + Will need to complete Guided Practice for Module 1A. Remind that it should take no more than an hour; graded only on completeness and effort; put some good-faith effort for an answer for EVERY item and ask questions about what you don't understand. Then the class meeting picks up where the GP leaves off, no re-teaching.
