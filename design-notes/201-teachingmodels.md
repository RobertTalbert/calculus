# Possible workflows/classroom configurations for MTH 201 

## If F2F is allowed 

### Model 1: Staggered hybrid with rotating groups 

- Students are put into groups of 4 and given individual designations (red, yellow, blue, green)
- Groups are kept until mid-semester, then optionally switched. Each group gets a private chat space on Campuswire and a Google Drive folder. 
- Representatives from groups are present in each class meeting: 
  - Red on Monday
  - Yellow on Tuesday
  - Blue on Wednesday
  - Green on Thursday 
- The rest of the group not present will tune in to live stream of class and interact virtually with their representative via Campuswire. 
- Otherwise the class is taught as it normally would be with a flipped structure. 
- Group activities outside the class: 
  - Rotate turns being group leader for the week. Group leader has the responsibility of meeting with me on Zoom once a week for 15 minutes to communicate issues and questions from the group. 


**I like this one because of the centrality of support groups. I worry about the large amount of synchronous activity happening.** 

### Model 1B: Staggered hybrid with rotating groups but the groups are larger

This will address the "requirement" that half of instruction be face-to-face. Everything is the same as Model 1 except the group representation is as follows: 

- Monday: Red/Yellow
- Tuesday: Red/Blue
- Wednesday: Yellow/Green
- Thursday: Blue/Green

Or some other way of doing it worked out among the groups, as long as each group member has the chance to attend 2 days per week. 

### Model 2: Staggered hybrid with fixed groups 

- Students are randomly assigned to two groups (red, blue). 
- Red group attends on MW, blue group attends on TR. 
- Course modules broken into A and B parts. For example: Module 2A = Section 1.3, Module 2B = Section 1.4. 
- All students regardless of group complete preclass work for part A on Sunday night, for part B on Tuesday night. 
- MT of each week is for active learning on part A of a module. WR is for active learning on part B. 
- Active learning in class would **not** be focused on "group work" but rather active learning that doesn't require strict grouping
  - Peer instruction -- pairs formed between those present and those not present, discuss via DM on CampusWire 
  - Working out problems at "the board" using Jamboard


### Model 2B: Staggered hybrid hyflex-esque

- At beginning of the semester: 
  - Students are put into two groups (Red and Blue) 
  - Each student also gets two partners, one from their color and one from the other. 
    - Purpose of the same-color partner is to pair off during class meetings 
    - Purpose of the other-color partner is to be a designated person to ask for questions or clarification -- could also attend synchronously and interact in real time 
  - This creates a group of four with half in one color half in the other -- a semester-long accountability/study group.
- Sundays and Tuesdays: Guided Practice due for A and B parts of each module.  
- F2F meetings MTWR. These are for: 
  - Q&A over Guided Practice 
  - Active work over "middle third" stuff (application/analysis) 
  - Debriefing of active work
  - **All F2F meetings are streamed and recorded.**
  - **All active learning tasks are made available for the week and posted by Sunday and can be done asynchronously if needed.**  
- MW: Red group attends F2F. 
- TR: Blue group attends F2F. 
- Additional, asynchronous activities are given to both groups to complete after T and R. -- Active learning tasks done to reach further learning objectives. Posted online and discussed. 



## If it's 100% online 

### Model 3: Online synchronous 

This one is the same as Model 1 except there's no group scheduling, just online meetings. 


### Model 4: Online asynchronous 

- Go ahead and assign students to groups. (Pairs? Threes? Fours?) As in Model 1. 
- Submit Guided Practice on Sunday and Tuesday
- Monday/Tuesday: Active work on module part A
- Wednesday/Thursday: Active work on module part B
- "Active work"
  - Completing practice problems in pairs or subgroups, posting to CampusWire
  - Discussion of higher-level Blooms Taxonomy questions 
- Friday: Open Q&A, time to work on other classwork 

### Model 5: Combo of synchronous/asynchronous 

This one resembles Model 2:  

- All students complete preclass work on Sunday + Tuesday for A/B parts 
- Monday: Synchronous meeting (recorded for those who cannot attend) to do active work on part A
- Tuesday: Asynchronous work on part A to complete Monday stuff plus extras 
- WR: Repeat MT except for part B
