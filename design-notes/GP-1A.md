# MTH 201: Calculus 

## Guided Practice, Module 1a: How do we measure velocity? 

**Due by:** 11:59pm Eastern, Tuesday September 1. 

**Estimated time requirement:** About 60 minutes for the whole assignment. *If you have worked on this assignment for 60 minutes and you're stuck, please DON'T work any further* --- instead, stop and ask for help on the `#guidedpractice` channel on CampusWire.

## Overview 

**Welcome to your first Guided Practice assignment in MTH 201.** These assignments are designed to guide you through the important ideast it’s going at a single moment in time? This simple question launches our study of calculus this semester. We will approach it by looking at the concept of average velocity, using a connection to the slope of a line. Then we’ll introduce the concept of instantaneous velocity and how to measure it.


## What you will learn in this modulen a small chunk of material that we will 

**Textbook coverage:** Section 1.1, "How do we measure velocity?" 

**Learning Targetobjectives addressed in this module:** 

> **L.1 (Core):** I can evaluate the limit (including one-sided and infinite limits) of a function at a point using graphical, numerical, or algebraic methods or explain why a limit fails to exist.

**BEFORE** your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following: 

- Compute the average velocity of a moving object on an interval using either of the average velocity formulas.
- Interpret the average velocity of a moving object as the slope of a line. 


**DURING AND AFTER** your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Explain the differences between average velocity and instantaneous velocity.
- Find the instantanous velocity of a moving object through a sequence of average velocities.:** 

**How to get help on this assignment:** You are allowed to collaborate freely with other students, use the internet, and ask questions from the instructor on this assignment. The best place to go for questions is the `#guidedpractice` channel on CampusWire, where you can ask your questions and see others'. 

## Resources for Learning 

**Text:** Read through Section 1.1 of the *Active Calculus* textbook: <https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-1-vel.html>  Work through the examples and all interactive exercises found at the end of the section. 

**Video:** At the MTH 201 playlist on YouTube (<http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus>), watch the following videos. The total running time is 32:48.

## Exercises 

The exercises for this Guided Practice are found at the links below. **Be sure to use only the link that corresponds to your course section.** 

- Students in Section 02 (10:00-10:50am meetings): <https://student.desmos.com/join/4qmfe4>

## Submission, grading, and getting help 

**Submitting your work:** To submit your work, just work through to the last part of the Desmos activity. Your work will be submitted as you go, so once you reach the end, you can just close out the window. 

**How this is graded:** Guided Practice assignments are graded either **P** (Pass) or **NP** (Does not Pass). You will receive a **P** if your work: (1) is submitted by the deadline, and (2) each required exercise has a response that reflects a good-faith effort to attain a correct answer. *Mathematical correctness is not reqAfter reading, watching, and otherwise using the resources above, work through EACH of the following exercises. Do your initial work in your own notes, and then use the submission form below to submit your work online. The form may also contain additional exercises for review and practice of previous material. 

The form is found here: (Link) 

Remember that Guided Practice assignments must have a good-faith effort to be right on each of these exercises. If you are stuck or have a question, go to the `#guirded for a grade of P, only completeness, effort, and meeting the deadline.* However, your work will receive an **NP** if your work is late, *or* if a required item is left blank (even accidentally), *or* if a required item does not show a good-faith effort to be right --- including responses of "I don't know", "I didn't understand", and so on. If you are stuck on an item, you're expected to ask questions and give your best effort. 

**Getting help on this assignment:** *You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others' answers.* Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the `#guidedpractice` channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.practice` channel on Slack for help. 


## Submitting your work

Submit your responses to the exercises using the form linked above. 

Your responses are due no later than **11:59pm Eastern time on the day indicated on the course calendar**. Submissions that are received by this deadline and in which each exercise has a good-faith attempt at a correct response will receive a Satisfactory mark and 1 engagement credit. Responses received after 11:59pm Eastern time will receive Unsatisfactory marks.
