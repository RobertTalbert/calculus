Welcome. This repository contains materials made by me, [Robert Talbert](http://proftalbert.com), for a university-level calculus course taught using an inverted or flipped class design. Under this design: 

+ Students work prior to class, through structured preparatory activities called Guided Practice, to attain fluency on a set of basic Learning Objectives. 
+ During class, students work actively with the instructor's direct assistance on challenging problems on deeper, more advanced learning objectives. 

The materials in this repo correspond to the chapters and sections in the textbook [Active Calculus](http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/Download.html) by Matt Boelkins, a free and open source calculus text. The repository contains the following materials: 

- Course documents including a sample course syllabus, a Style Guide for writing in calculus, and more. (These are in the top-level directory.)
- Guided Practice assignments keyed to sections in Active Calculus. 
- In-class activities. 
- Problems for a Portfolio assignment, which was used in our calculus class as a semester-long project.  
- Tests and the final exam from the Fall 2013 offering of this course. 

Other materials can be found on [the web site for my Fall 2013 instance of this course](http://teaching.proftalbert.com/mth201f13). 

Over 9 hours of video screencasts were created for this course and are housed [at the GVSU Mathematics Department YouTube channel](http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus).
