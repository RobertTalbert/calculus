Welcome. This repository contains materials made by me, [Robert Talbert](http://rtalbert.org), for a university-level calculus course taught using an inverted or flipped class design. Under this design: 

+ Students work prior to class, through structured preparatory activities called Guided Practice, to attain fluency on a set of basic Learning Objectives. 
+ During class, students work actively with the instructor's direct assistance on challenging problems on deeper, more advanced learning objectives. 

The course also uses specifications grading, which is described [here](http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=30598). 

The materials in this repo correspond to the chapters and sections in the textbook [Active Calculus](https://activecalculus.org/single/) by Matt Boelkins, a free and open source calculus text. Over 9 hours of video screencasts were created for this course and are housed [at the GVSU Mathematics Department YouTube channel](http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus). 

I have made no effort to standardize the format or appearance of the course materials found on this repo. Some items are Markdown files, some PDFs, some Word documents, etc. This is just a dumping ground and I have not attempted to make things user-friendly. On the other hand, everything here is free and licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/). 

## Important notes about Fall 2018 

- Many of the Fall 2018 materials are Google Docs or Google Slides and it's far easier to keep those on Google Drive than convert them to a GitHub friendly format. I have left the class folder open and [you can access all the stuff here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YqJRi657BtBi_XipD3g1IYw3iY7G71SL). 
- Some of the course activities were done on Overleaf and [you can view those here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zbkvqpqbyrrd).
- The Learning Target quizzes were all done on Overleaf. There are well over 150 of these and [you can view them here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hyxgvrvmvhvy
). 
-  Same deal with the Labs -- [those are found here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ychjvqvdzymt).
