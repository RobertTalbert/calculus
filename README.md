Welcome. This repository contains materials made by me, [Robert Talbert](http://rtalbert.org), for a university-level calculus course taught using an inverted or flipped class design. Under this design: 

+ Students work prior to class, through structured preparatory activities called Guided Practice, to attain fluency on a set of basic Learning Objectives. 
+ During class, students work actively with the instructor's direct assistance on challenging problems on deeper, more advanced learning objectives. 

The course also uses specifications grading, which is described [here](http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=30598). 

The materials in this repo correspond to the chapters and sections in the textbook [Active Calculus](http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/Download.html) by Matt Boelkins, a free and open source calculus text. 

Other materials can be found on [the web site for my Fall 2013 instance of this course](http://teaching.proftalbert.com/mth201f13). 

Over 9 hours of video screencasts were created for this course and are housed [at the GVSU Mathematics Department YouTube channel](http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus).
