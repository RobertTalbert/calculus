# Calculus materials 

This repository houses materials for my Calculus classes at [Grand Valley State University](http://www.gvsu.edu). The items in the top level are from the version of the course offered Winter semester 2021 (January-April). That version of the course is being offered in a synchronous online format. 

The Fall semester 2020 version of the course is archived in the **Fall 2020** folder. That instance was taught in an "asynchronous staggered hybrid" format -- basically hyflex with students meeting twice a week in person and completing the rest of the work asynchronously, and the student groups were staggered M/T and W/R for social distancing purposes. (It was complicated.) 

All instances of this course feature: 

* A **flipped learning structure** where students first encounter new concepts through structured guided inquiry assignments (called *Daily Preps*) and then class time/asynchronous work is focused on mid-level tasks of analysis and application. 
* A **mastery grading assessment system** where almost none of the assignments carried a point value, but student progress in the course was based on the quantity and quality of work completed at or above professional quality standards. 
* A significant use of **technology to drive learning experiences** including the free use of [Wolfram|Alpha](http://wolframalpha.com) and [Desmos](http://desmos.com) on assessments and in class.
