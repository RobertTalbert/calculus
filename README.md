# Overview 

This repository contains materials for MTH 201 (Calculus) at [Grand Valley State University](http://gvsu.edu). These materials were created and are maintained by me, [Robert Talbert](http://rtalbert.org). 

The top-level directory contains materials from the most recent offering of the course. All others are found in the `/archive` directory organized by semester. 

The materials in this repo correspond to the chapters and sections in the textbook [Active Calculus](https://activecalculus.org/single/) by Matt Boelkins, a free and open source calculus text. Over 9 hours of video screencasts were created for this course and are housed [at the GVSU Mathematics Department YouTube channel](http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus).

## Important notes about Fall 2018 

- Many of the Fall 2018 materials are Google Docs or Google Slides and it's far easier to keep those on Google Drive than convert them to a GitHub friendly format. I have left the class folder open and [you can access all the stuff here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YqJRi657BtBi_XipD3g1IYw3iY7G71SL). 
- Some of the course activities were done on Overleaf and [you can view those here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zbkvqpqbyrrd).
- The Learning Target quizzes were all done on Overleaf. There are well over 150 of these and [you can view them here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hyxgvrvmvhvy
). 
-  Same deal with the Labs -- [those are found here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ychjvqvdzymt).
