## Learning Targets 

- Bold items are course-level objectives 
- These don't appear in chronological order
- 

**Group F: I can use functions and other pre-Calculus mathematics proficiently.** 

- F.1: I can read and use graphs, tables, and formulas to access relevant information within a problem. 
- F.2: I can use appropriate algebraic techniques and terminology, including function notation, to help me solve problems. 
- F.3: I can identify the fundamental algebraic structure of a function (product, composite, etc.). 

**Note**: All F targets are assessed and completed by passing the Functions Bootcamp Exam. 

**Group L: I can calculate, use, and explain the concept of limits.** 

- L.1*: I can evaluate the limit (including one-sided and infinite limits) of a function at a point using graphical, numerical, or algebraic methoDC or explain why a limit fails to exist.
- L.2: I can determine where a function is and is not continuous and explain my reasoning using limits. 
- L.3: I can identify limits in indeterminate form and apply L'Hopital's Rule to evaluate them. 

**Note:** May need to introduce one-sided and infinite limits early. 

**Group DM: I can explain and interpret the meaning of the derivative of a function.** 
    
- DM.1: I can state the definition of the derivative of a function at a point and as a function, and I can explain the purpose of each symbol in the definition. 
- DM.2*: I can calculate derivatives using the definition and estimate derivatives using difference quotients (including average and instantaneous velocities). 
- DM.3: I can find an equation of the tangent line to the graph of a function at a point. 
- DM.4*: I can correctly interpret the meaning of a derivative in context and state its units. 
- DM.5: I can recognize points at which a function is (and is not) differentiable, and can use the definition or interpretation of the derivative to support my thinking.
- DM.6: I can find the local linearization of a function at a point and use it to estimate values of the function. 
- DM.7: I can use derivative notation correctly (such as $f'(x)$, $\frac{d}{dx}$, and $\frac{dy}{dx}$)

**I can use shortcuts to calculate derivatives efficiently.** 
- DC.1*: I can compute derivatives correctly for power, polynomial, exponential, trigonometric, logarithmic, and inverse trigonometric functions and simple combinations of these (constant multiples, sums, differences). 
- DC.2*: I can compute derivatives correctly for products, quotients, and composites of functions. 
- DC.3: I can compute derivatives correctly using multiple rules in combination. 
- DC.4: I can compute derivatives correctly using implicit differentiation. 

**I can use derivatives to solve authentic real-life application problems.** 
   
- DA.1*: Given information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$, I can draw conclusions about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$. 
- DA.2*: I can find the critical values of a function, determine where the function is increasing and decreasing, and apply the First and Second Derivative Tests to classify the critical points as local extrema. 
- DA.3: I can determine the intervals of concavity of a function and find all of its points of inflection. 
- DA.4: I can use the Extreme Value Theorem to find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a close interval.
- DA.5*: I can set up and use derivatives to solve applied optimization problems. 
- DA.6: I can set up and use derivatives to solve related rates problems. 

**I can use definite integrals and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find areas and total change.** 

- FTC.1: I can calculate the area between curves, net change, and displacement using geometric formulas and Riemann sums. 
- FTC.2: I can explain the meaning of each part of the definition of the definite integral in terms of a graph, and interpret the definite integral in terms of areas, net change, and displacement. 
- FTC.3*: I can evaluate a definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Properties of the Definite Integral. 
- FTC.4*: I can correctly anti-differentiate basic functions and identify antiderivatives. 
- FTC.5: I can find the average value of a function and the net change in a function over an interval using a definite integral.
