**I can use functions and other pre-Calculus mathematics proficiently.** 
    I can read and use graphs, tables, and formulas to access relevant information within a problem. 
    I can use appropriate algebraic techniques and terminology, including function notation, to help me solve problems. 
    I can identify the fundamental algebraic structure of a function (product, composite, etc.). 

**I can calculate, use, and explain the concept of limits.** 
    I can evaluate the limit (including one-sided and infinite limits) of a function at a point using graphical, numerical, or algebraic methods. 
    I can determine where a function is and is not continuous or differentiable. 
    I can identify limits in indeterminate form and apply L'Hopital's Rule to evaluate them. 

**I can explain and interpret the meaning of the derivative of a function.** 
    I can state the definition of the derivative of a function both at a point and as a function, and I can explain the purpose of each symbol in the definition. 
    I can calculate derivatives and estimates of derivatives using different quotients (including average and instantaneous velocities). 
    I can find an equation of the tangent line to the graph of a function at a point. 

**I can use shortcuts to calculate derivatives efficiently.** 
    I can compute derivatives correctly for basic functions (power, polynomial, exponential, sine and cosine) and simple combinations of basic functions (constant multiples, sums, differences). 
    I can compute derivatives correctly for products, quotients, and composites of functions. 
    I can compute derivatives correctly using multiple rules in combination. 
    I can compute derivatives correctly for logarithmic and inverse trigonometric functions. 
    I can compute derivatives correctly using implicit differentiation. 

**I can use derivatives to solve authentic real-life application problems.** 
    I can state the units of the derivative of a function and draw correct conclusions about a function given information about its derivative (and vice versa).
    Given information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$, I can draw conclusions about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$. 
    I can find the critical values of a function, determine where the function is increasing and decreasing, and apply the First and Second Derivative Tests to classify the critical points as local extrema. 
    I can determine the intervals of concavity of a function and find all of its points of inflection. 
    I can use the Extreme Value Theorem to find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a closed interval.

    I can state the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and use it to find the exact value of a definite integral.
    I can find the most general antiderivative of a function.  
    I can find the total amount of change in a function over an interval using a definite integral.
