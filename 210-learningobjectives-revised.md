**Group F: I can use functions and other pre-Calculus mathematics proficiently.** 

- F.1: I can read and use graphs, tables, and formulas to access relevant information within a problem. 
- F.2: I can use appropriate algebraic techniques and terminology, including function notation, to help me solve problems. 
- F.3: I can identify the fundamental algebraic structure of a function (product, composite, etc.). 

**Note**: All F targets are assessed and completed by passing the Functions Bootcamp Exam. 

**Group L: I can calculate, use, and explain the concept of limits.** 

- L.1: I can evaluate the limit (including one-sided and infinite limits) of a function at a point using graphical, numerical, or algebraic methods. 
- L.2: I can determine where a function is and is not continuous or differentiable. 
- L.3: I can identify limits in indeterminate form and apply L'Hopital's Rule to evaluate them. 

**Note:** May need to introduce one-sided and infinite limits early. 

**Group DM: I can explain and interpret the meaning of the derivative of a function.** 
    
- DM.1: I can state the definition of the derivative of a function both at a point and as a function, and I can explain the purpose of each symbol in the definition. 
- DM.2: I can calculate derivatives and estimates of derivatives using different quotients (including average and instantaneous velocities). 
- DM.3: I can find an equation of the tangent line to the graph of a function at a point. 

**I can use shortcuts to calculate derivatives efficiently.** 
- DS.1: I can compute derivatives correctly for basic functions (power, polynomial, exponential, sine and cosine) and simple combinations of basic functions (constant multiples, sums, differences). 
- DS.2: I can compute derivatives correctly for products, quotients, and composites of functions. 
- DS.3: I can compute derivatives correctly using multiple rules in combination. 
- DS.4: I can compute derivatives correctly for trigonometric, logarithmic and inverse trigonometric functions. 
- DS.5: I can compute derivatives correctly using implicit differentiation. 

**I can use derivatives to solve authentic real-life application problems.** 
   
- DA.1: I can state the units of the derivative of a function and draw correct conclusions about a function given information about its derivative (and vice versa).
- DA.2: Given information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$, I can draw conclusions about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$. 
- DA.3: I can find the critical values of a function, determine where the function is increasing and decreasing, and apply the First and Second Derivative Tests to classify the critical points as local extrema. 
- DA.4: I can determine the intervals of concavity of a function and find all of its points of inflection. 
- DA.5: I can use the Extreme Value Theorem to find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a closed interval.
- DA.6: I can set up and use derivatives to solve applied optimization problems. 
- DA.7: I can set up and use derivatives to solve related rates problems. 

**I can use definite integrals to find areas and total change.** 

- INT.1: I can find the exact value of a definite integral using a combination of geometric formulas and the Properties of the Definite Integral.
- INT.2: I can find the average value of a function over an interval. 
- INT.3: I can state the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and use it to find the exact value of a definite integral.
- INT.4: I can find the most general antiderivative of a function.  
- INT.5: I can find the total amount of change in a function over an interval using a definite integral.
