# Planning for Module 4

Coverage: 2.1-2.2

Micro objectives: 

-   Compute (without using limits) the derivatives of constant, power, and exponential functions.
-   Compute the derivative of constant multiples and sums of constant, power, and exponential functions.
-   Compute the derivative of the sine and cosine functions.
-   Use basic derivative rules to solve problems about slopes, velocities, and rates of change involving basic functions.

Main learning targets: 

- DC.1 **(CORE)**: I can compute derivatives correctly for power, polynomial, and exponential functions and the sine and cosine functions, and basic combinations of these (constant multiples, sums, differences).


## Part A

Basic: 

-   Compute (without using limits) the derivatives of constant, power, and exponential functions.
-  Compute the derivative of constant multiples and sums of constant, power, and exponential functions.

Advanced:

-   Use basic derivative rules to solve problems about slopes, velocities, and rates of change involving basic functions.


Notes: 

- Add review for exponential functions, natural log, the number e
- Class activity focuses on Activities 2.1.3 and 2.1.4
- Followup is on more applications, correct use of notation, second derivatives and concavity




## Part B

-   Compute the derivative of the sine and cosine functions.
-   Use basic derivative rules to solve problems about slopes, velocities, and rates of change involving basic functions.

Pre-class: 

- Desmos activity to sketch derivative of sin(x) 
- Why isn't derivative of cos(x) = sin(x)
- Trig review (just sin, cos values) 


In class: 

- Activity 2.2.4 plus Exercise 2



## Throwaway -- math notation

$h(w) = w^{3/4}$
