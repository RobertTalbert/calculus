# Module 3 planning 

- D.2 (CORE): I can use derivative notation correctly, state the units of a derivative, estimate the value of a derivative using difference quotients, and correctly interpret the meaning of a derivative in context.
- D.3 (CORE): Given information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$, I can correctly give information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$ and the increasing/decreasing behavior and concavity of $f$ (and vice versa).
- D.4: I can determine where a function is continuous or differentiable given a graph or formula of the function and explain my reasoning.


## 3A

Covers 1.5, 1.6

- Determine whether a function is increasing, decreasing, or constant on an interval by examining the sign of its derivative. (Conversely, state the sign of a function's derivative using information about whether the function is increasing, decreasing, or constant.)
- Interpret the meaning of the derivative of a function that models a real-life situation, in terms instantaneous rates of change.
- Estimate the value of a derivative at a point using forward, backward, and central difference calculations.
- State the definition of the second derivative of a function.



- Explain the meaning of the terms concave up and concave down and explain the connection between concavity of a function and its first and second derivatives.
- Determine whether a function is concave up or concave down on an interval by examining its graph.
- Given the graph of a function, make a reasonable sketch of the graph of its second derivative.
- If a function is given with units for the input and output, state the units of the second derivative.

In class- focus on concavity 

+ Polling Q on incr/decr behavior, meaning of the derivative, concavity (by graph) 
+ Activity -- do estimate of a derivative; draw a function that's (incr/decr) and (CU/CD) 
+ Demo to connect concavity with second derivative 
+ Peer instruction -- position, velocity, acceleration 


## 3B

Covers 1.7, 1.8

- Compute left- and right-hand limits of a function at a point.
- Describe the conditions under which the limit of a function at a point exists; and state the conditions under which a limit will fail to exist.
- State and explain the conditions under which a function is continuous (or fails to be continuous) at a point or on an interval.
- State and explain conditions under which a function is differentiable at a point (or fails to be differentiable at a point).
- Determine whether a function is continuous at a point or differentiable at a point given its graph or a formula.
- Find the local linearization of a function near a given point, and use the local linearization to predict values of the function.
- Use the concavity of a function to determine whether a local linear approximation is an overestimate or underestimate.
