<h2 id="daily-preparation-module-2a-the-derivative-of-a-function">Daily Preparation, Module 2A: The derivative of a function</h2>
<p><strong>Due by:</strong> 11:59pm ET, Sunday September 13</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time requirement:</strong> No more than 60 minutes for the whole assignment. <em>If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you’re not at least halfway done, DON’T work any further</em> — instead, <em>stop and ask for help</em> on the <code>#dailyprep</code> channel on CampusWire.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this section we make first contact with the most central concept in the course: The notion of <strong>the derivative of a function</strong>. The derivative of a function at a point is essentially the same thing as the instantaneous velocity of an object at a single point in time, but the derivative is more general and encompasses a much wider range of applications than just motion. In the section, we define the derivative of a function at a point in terms of average rates of change and limits; introduce the “prime” notation for the derivative; discuss the units of measurement for the derivative; and connect the derivative to the geometric concept of a tangent line and especially its slope.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p><strong>Learning Targets addressed in this module:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>D.1 <strong>(CORE)</strong>: I can find the derivative of a function, both at a point and as a function, using thedefinition of the derivative.</li>
<li>D.2 <strong>(CORE)</strong>: I can use derivative notation correctly, state the units of a derivative, estimatethe value of a derivative using difference quotients, and correctly interpret the meaning of aderivative in context.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>State the formal definition of the derivative of a function.</li>
<li>Explain the meaning of the various parts of the definition of the derivative.</li>
<li>State the units of a derivative.</li>
<li>Interpret the meaning of a derivative in terms of instantaneous velocity and the slopes of tangent and secant lines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DURING AND AFTER</strong> your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute the derivative of a function at a point by setting up and evaluating the limit in its definition.</li>
<li>Apply the derivative to questions about rates of change and tangent lines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources-for-learning">Resources for Learning</h2>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> Read through Section 1.3 of the <em>Active Calculus</em> textbook: <a href="https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-3-derivative-pt.html">https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-3-derivative-pt.html</a>  Work through the examples and all interactive exercises found at the end of the section.</p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> At the MTH 201 playlist on YouTube (<a href="http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus">http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus</a>), watch the following videos. The total running time is 17:18.</p>

<p>You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The exercises for this assignment are all in a Desmos activity this time. Click on the link below that corresponds to your section. <strong>Be sure to only use the link for your section</strong> or your work will end up in the wrong place.</p>
<ul>

<li>Section 04: <a href="https://student.desmos.com/join/kq268s">https://student.desmos.com/join/kq268s</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Your work is saved as you go, so there’s no “submit” step at the end.</p>
<h2 id="submission-grading-and-getting-help">Submission, grading, and getting help</h2>
<p><strong>Submitting your work:</strong> Just work through the activities; your work is saved as you go.</p>
<p><strong>How this is graded:</strong> Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of <em>completeness and effort</em>: If your submission has <strong>all parts completed</strong> (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and <strong>a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given</strong> (no responses of “I don’t know” or “I didn’t understand”) and <strong>the work is submitted on time</strong>, it gets a “check”. Otherwise it gets an “x”. If you are stuck on an item, you’re expected to ask questions and give your best effort.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help on this assignment:</strong> <em>You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others’ answers.</em> Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.</p>
