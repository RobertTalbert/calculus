# MTH 201: Calculus 

## Daily Preparation, Module 2A: The derivative of a function

**Due by:** 11:59pm ET, Sunday September 13

**Estimated time requirement:** No more than 60 minutes for the whole assignment. *If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you're not at least halfway done, DON'T work any further* --- instead, *stop and ask for help* on the `#dailyprep` channel on CampusWire. 

## Overview 

In this section we make first contact with the most central concept in the course: The notion of **the derivative of a function**. The derivative of a function at a point is essentially the same thing as the instantaneous velocity of an object at a single point in time, but the derivative is more general and encompasses a much wider range of applications than just motion. In the section, we define the derivative of a function at a point in terms of average rates of change and limits; introduce the "prime" notation for the derivative; discuss the units of measurement for the derivative; and connect the derivative to the geometric concept of a tangent line and especially its slope.


## What you will learn 

**Learning Targets addressed in this module:** 

- D.1 **(CORE)**: I can find the derivative of a function, both at a point and as a function, using thedefinition of the derivative. 
- D.2 **(CORE)**: I can use derivative notation correctly, state the units of a derivative, estimatethe value of a derivative using difference quotients, and correctly interpret the meaning of aderivative in context. 

**BEFORE** your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following: 

- State the formal definition of the derivative of a function.
- Explain the meaning of the various parts of the definition of the derivative. 
- State the units of a derivative. 
- Interpret the meaning of a derivative in terms of instantaneous velocity and the slopes of tangent and secant lines.

**DURING AND AFTER** your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Compute the derivative of a function at a point by setting up and evaluating the limit in its definition.
- Apply the derivative to questions about rates of change and tangent lines. 

## Resources for Learning

**Text:** Read through Section 1.3 of the *Active Calculus* textbook: https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-3-derivative-pt.html  Work through the examples and all interactive exercises found at the end of the section. 

**Video:** At the MTH 201 playlist on YouTube (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus), watch the following videos. The total running time is 17:18. 

- Screencast 1.3.1: Quick review -- The derivative of a function at a point (2:22) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zpQnwVaU28
- Screencast 1.3.2: The derivative of a function at a point (9:12) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ5yelPpFk0
- Screencast 1.3.3: Derivative of a function at a point using graphs (5:44) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DJPSYeLFpc

You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.


## Exercises

The exercises for this assignment are all in a Desmos activity this time. Click on the link below that corresponds to your section. **Be sure to only use the link for your section** or your work will end up in the wrong place. 

- Section 02: https://student.desmos.com/join/m92nwk
- Section 04: https://student.desmos.com/join/kq268s 

Your work is saved as you go, so there's no "submit" step at the end. 

## Submission, grading, and getting help 

**Submitting your work:** Just work through the activities; your work is saved as you go. 

**How this is graded:** Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of *completeness and effort*: If your submission has **all parts completed** (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and **a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given** (no responses of "I don't know" or "I didn't understand") and **the work is submitted on time**, it gets a "check". Otherwise it gets an "x". If you are stuck on an item, you're expected to ask questions and give your best effort.  

**Getting help on this assignment:** *You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others' answers.* Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.
