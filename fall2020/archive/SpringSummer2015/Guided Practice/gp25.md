# Guided Practice 2.5: The Chain Rule

## Overview

This section introduces a very important rule: The Chain Rule, which is used to differentiate *composite* functions. Composite functions are functions composed (hence the name) of two or more functions "chained" together in sequence, such as $f(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)^{1/2}$. Many functions in applications are composites and so this rule gives us a much broader range of functions we can work with in calculus. The Chain Rule is also used as a basis for several upcoming concepts involving derivatives in which we have incomplete information about the functions involved. 

The Chain Rule is a Big Idea, and so we will actually be spending the entire week on jsut this one section. 

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). 

- State the Chain Rule and explain how it works in English. 
- Identify situations where the Chain Rule should be used when taking a derivative. 
- Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a simple composite function, for example a composition of a polynomial and a power function (e.g., $f(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)^{1/2}$).

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

- Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a composite function involving two functions. 
- Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a composite function involving three or more functions. 
- Use the Chain Rule in combination with other rules from earlier in this chapter. 
- Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a composite function in which at least one of the functions in the composite is given as a graph or a table of values.

## Learning resources 

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following. 

__Textbook__: In _Active Calculus_, read Section 2.5. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go. 

__Video__: Watch the following videos at the MTH 201 YouTube playlist (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus). **This is a considerably longer list this time**, because (1) many students find the Chain Rule hard to grasp, and so we've prepared lots of examples; and (2) this one section occupies the entire week and there is no second section this week with its own set of videos. These have a total running time of 41 minutes, 38 seconds:

Here are two optional videos if you need a refresher on the concept of a composite function:

- [Composition of functions part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9W90mcVAqg) (6:23)


## Exercises

The following exercises are to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. 

In Preview Activity 2.5 you are asked to tell whether the "fundamental algebraic structure" of a function is a sum, product, quotient, or composition of functions; and if the function is a composition, give a formula for the inner function and a formula for the outer function. Here is a solution for part (a), given the function $h(x) = \tan(2^x)$. The fundamental structure here is a composition, with the inner function being $g(x) = 2^x$ and the outer function being $f(x) = \tan(x)$.

Now you do the following: 

1. Work Preview Activity 2.5(b).
2. Work Preview Activity 2.5(c).
3. Work Preview Activity 2.5(d).
4. Work Preview Activity 2.5(e).
5. Work Preview Activity 2.5(f).
6. As a final activity, differentiate the function $y = (x^2 + 2x + 5)^4$ using the Chain Rule. In the submission form, first state the "inside" and "outside" functions, then state your answer. You can use technology to check your work, but the point here is to get basic practice with the Chain Rule, so don't _do_ the work using technology.
