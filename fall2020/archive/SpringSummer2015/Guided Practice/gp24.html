<h1 id="guided-practice-2.4-derivatives-of-other-trigonometric-functions">Guided Practice 2.4: Derivatives of other trigonometric functions</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this section, we will use the Product and Quotient Rules along with our rules for differentiating <span class="math">\(\sin(x)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\cos(x)\)</span> to derive formulas for the derivatives of the remaining four trigonometric functions: <span class="math">\(\tan(x)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\cot(x)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\sec(x)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\csc(x)\)</span>. We will then use these trigonometric derivatives in problems involving angles and cyclical behavior.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>(<em>Review</em>) State the definitions of the tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions.</li>
<li>(<em>Review</em>) State where the sine and cosine functions attain a value of 0.</li>
<li>(<em>Review</em>) State the “Fundamental Trigonometric Identity”. (Hint: Look on page 113.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Derive the rules for differentiating <span class="math">\(\tan(x)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\cot(x)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\sec(x)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\csc(x)\)</span> &quot;from scratch&quot; using only basic derivative rules and trigonometric identities.</li>
<li>State the derivatives of <span class="math">\(\tan(x)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\cot(x)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\sec(x)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\csc(x)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use the above rules in the context of a real-world problem to find the slope of a tangent line, the instantaneous rate of change in a function, or the instantaneous velocity of an object.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In <em>Active Calculus</em>, read Section 2.4. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: Watch the following videos at the MTH 201 YouTube playlist (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus). <strong>Note</strong>: Before viewing these, you may first need to refresh yourself on the definitions of the trigonometric functions that are involved. It's up to you how you want to do this -- through reading on the web, watching other videos found through a YouTube search, or just wing it. But be honest with yourself -- if you are not understanding the trig, stop and find help.</p>
