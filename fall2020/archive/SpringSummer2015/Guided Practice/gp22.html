<h1 id="guided-practice-2.2-the-sine-and-cosine-functions">Guided Practice 2.2: The sine and cosine functions</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Now that we have general computational rules for power functions, exponential functions, constant multiples, and sums/differences of functions, we will add another family of functions to the toolbox: The trigonometric functions. In this section you will develop rules for the derivatives of the functions <span class="math">\(y = \sin(x)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y = \cos(x)\)</span> as part of the activities in the class. Then we will use those rules in applied problems that involve angles and cyclic behavior.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>(<em>Trigonometry review</em>) State the values of <span class="math">\(\sin x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\cos x\)</span> at the angle values <span class="math">\(0, \pi/6, \pi/4, \pi/3, \pi/2\)</span> and other related points on the unit circle <em>without a calculator</em>. (<a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/AlgebraTrigReview/TrigFunctions.aspx">Here</a> is a good resource for trigonometry review, as well as a <a href="http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/43200/43216/unit-circle8_43216.htm">nice unit circle cheat sheet</a> you can print off and carry around. There are also tons of great trigonometry resources on YouTube.)</li>
<li>(<em>Trigonometry review</em>) State the definitions of the tangent, contangent, secant, and cosecant functions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>State the derivatives of the functions <span class="math">\(y = \sin(x)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y = \cos(x)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use the derivatives of <span class="math">\(y = \sin(x)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y = \cos(x)\)</span> in the context of a real-world problem to find the slope of a tangent line, the instantaneous rate of change in a function, or the instantaneous velocity of an object.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In <em>Active Calculus</em>, read Section 2.2. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: Watch the following videos. These are obviously not made by Prof. Talbert.</p>
<ul>
<li>Radians and degrees <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcfkDuFpbiM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcfkDuFpbiM</a></li>
<li>Basic trigonometry: Sin, Cos, Tan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5uFqpypDy4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5uFqpypDy4</a></li>
<li>How to remember the unit circle <a href="http://youtu.be/qTbDQ9gkKJg">http://youtu.be/qTbDQ9gkKJg</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<p>Here is an interactive applet that shows the function <span class="math">\(y = \sin(x)\)</span> (in black) and <span class="math">\(y = \cos(x)\)</span> (in red). Also shown are two draggable tangent lines and associated points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tangent line at point A is a tangent line to the graph of <span class="math">\(\sin(x)\)</span>, and the point in the shape of an &quot;X&quot; lies on the graph of the derivative of <span class="math">\(\sin(x)\)</span>. That is, the height of the &quot;X&quot; is the slope of the tangent line at point A. So when you drag the tangent line across the <span class="math">\(\sin(x)\)</span> graph, the &quot;X&quot; point traces out the graph of the derivative of <span class="math">\(\sin(x)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Similarly, the tangent line at point B is a tangent line to the graph of <span class="math">\(\cos(x)\)</span>, and the point in the shape of a &quot;+&quot; lies on the graph of the derivative of <span class="math">\(\cos(x)\)</span>. That is, the height of the &quot;+&quot; is the slope of the tangent line at point B. So when you drag the tangent line across the <span class="math">\(\cos(x)\)</span> graph, the &quot;+&quot; point traces out the graph of the derivative of <span class="math">\(\cos(x)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the check boxes to turn on/off the tangent lines.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Drag the tangent line on <span class="math">\(\sin(x)\)</span> and observe the &quot;X&quot; point. Based on your observations, to what function is the derivative of <span class="math">\(\sin(x)\)</span> equal?</li>
<li>Drag the tangent line on <span class="math">\(\cos(x)\)</span> and observe the &quot;+&quot; point. Based on your observations, is the derivative of <span class="math">\(\cos(x)\)</span> equal to <span class="math">\(\sin(x)\)</span>? Explain.</li>
<li>Based on your observations, how does the derivative of <span class="math">\(\cos(x)\)</span> relate to the graph of <span class="math">\(\sin(x)\)</span>? That is, is the derivative of <span class="math">\(\cos(x)\)</span> equal to <span class="math">\(\sin(x)\)</span>, is it equal to <span class="math">\(\sin(x)\)</span> with a vertical shift, etc.?</li>
<li>Any other questions?</li>
