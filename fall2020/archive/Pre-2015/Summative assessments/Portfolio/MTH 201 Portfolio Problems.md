## General Information 

Portfolio Problems are calculus problems that address some of the core ideas of the subject at a level of depth that is considerably greater than typical homework exercises and lab work. They combine conceptual understanding, computational skill, and effective problem solving to challenge and stretch your abilities. 

During the course, you will be completing eight such problems that you will choose from the list given below. Read on for guidelines regarding deadlines and other information.

## How to work portfolio problems

For the most part, portfolio problems are like ordinary homework problems, and you will work them out like ordinary homework problems. The main differences are that **portfolio problems are significantly more difficult than WeBWorK or class activity problems**; and **communication in the style and at the level of a professional is required**. In other words, portfolio problems will ask you to work out difficult mathematical problems with a high level of independence and communicate your result in a clear way, formatted as a professional would format her or his work. 

The process for selecting and working portfolio problems follows: 

1. When you are ready to work on a portfolio problem, first select the problem you wish. For example, for Problem 1, you may choose either Exercise 2 or Exercise 3 from section 1.3. Do not make your choice blindly; play with each problem and decide which one you like best. The list of portfolio problems is at the end of this page. 
2. Once you have selected a problem, you may choose to work on it individually or in collaboration with one other student in your section. You may not work with students outside your section or with more than one other student. **You must work at least two of the eight portfolio problems individually**. **If you say you are working individually but there is evidence that you have worked with more than one other student, it will be treated as academic dishonesty.** 
3. Once you've selected a problem and decided whether you will work on it individually or in a group, you may begin to work out your solution. **While you are working, you may submit questions to the professor (me) at any time. However, note that since this is a major assignment with a top goal of developing your skills as an independent problem solver, my responses to those questions will not include specific hints or specific instructions on how to get started or proceed in a solution.** Instead, I will likely respond to those questions with other questions that will help you find the answer on your own, such as: *Do you understand all the terms in the problem? Have you ever seen a similar but related problem? Can you solve a simplified version of the problem?* And so on. These questions will help you find the way to get unstuck on your own.
4. You may work out your initial solution by hand, but official submissions for portfolio problems must be typed up using a word processor or a typesetting program. See the next section for details.  
5. Questions about technology or logistics (for example, how to do a particular thing in LaTeX or whether your font is large enough) are welcome at any time and will get a "straight" answer. 

## How to write up and submit portfolio problems and make corrections

**If you are working a portfolio problem individually, then you are allowed to submit your solution twice: once as an initial draft, and again as a final draft after making corrections based on my feedback**. When you submit an initial draft, I will review the solution, make comments and feedback, and return that feedback to you within three working days of submission. For example, an initial draft submitted on a Tuesday will receive feedback by 5pm Friday; a draft submitted on a Saturday will receive feedback by 5pm Wednesday. Faster turnaround might happen but cannot be guaranteed. Also, please note that although I will read your work carefully, I may not catch all errors and corrections that need to be made when I give feedback on initial drafts; the final proofreading of your solution is your responsibility. 

**If you are working a portfolio problem with a partner, you may not submit an initial draft; your submission of a solution with your partner is considered final**. Collaboration with another student is assumed to serve the same purpose as getting feedback from the professor. 

Once you've completed your solution to a portfolio problem, it's time to turn it in. Here's how this works. 

1. **Portfolio solutions must be written in accordance with the MTH 201 Style Manual.** This document gives a very brief set of guidelines for correct grammar, mathematical writing, and graphs. *First make sure that you've abided by all the Style Manual guidelines*. 
2. **Portfolio Problems must be typed up using software that is capable of rendering mathematical notation**. Examples of such software include Microsoft Word (using Equation Editor), Google Docs (which also has an equation editor), and LaTeX (a mathematical typesetting language used commonly in math and science fields). No handwritten work will be accepted, and note that the Style Manual prohibits plain-text formatting of mathematical notation (such as writing x^2 instead of x2). 
3. The previous point includes graphs. These must be made using Geogebra, Wolfram|Alpha, or some other piece of mathematical software. You may not take screenshots from a graphing calculator, nor may you draw graphs by hand using pencil and paper. If you need to draw a graph freehand (as some of the portfolio problems ask you to do) then you can use a "paint" program or Geogebra (select the "Pen" tool in Geogebra which lets you draw freehand). **Graphs must be exported as graphics files and included in the same PDF as the writeup -- not as a separate PDF**. 
4. **Portfolio problem writeups must be saved as PDF files**. Files that are submitted as Microsoft Word files (ending in .doc or .docx) or any other format besides PDF will be returned to the student ungraded. Each solution should consist of a single PDF; multiple PDF's for the same submission (for example if you save your writing in one PDF and a graph in another) will be returned ungraded. If you are unsure how to create a PDF file for submission, please ask the professor (or Google it). 
5. The name of your PDF file should have the following format: 

SecNo LastName ProblemNumber [initial | final].pdf 

Where SecNo is your course section number (either 03 or 07), LastName is your last name (or your last name together with your partner's, if you are working collaboratively) ProblemNumber is the portfolio problem number (1, 2, ..., 8), and [initial | final] means either put "initial" or "final" depending on whether your submission is intended to be an initial or a final draft. For example, If Bob Smith is a student in MTH 201 section 07 and is turning in an initial draft  of Portfolio Problem 6, his file name would be 

Sec07 Smith 6 initial.pdf 

Once Bob has read the feedback on his initial draft and re-worked the solution, he would create a new document for the final draft titled

Sec07 Smith 6 final.pdf 

If Bob is working with Alice McGyver (also from section 07, as the rules require) on Problem 4, then the file name would be 

Sec07 McGyverSmith 4 final.pdf

This is automatically a final draft because they are working as a pair. Note the spaces between each of the four elements of the file name. Files with incorrectly formatted file names will not be graded. 

To submit your work on a portfolio problem, simply add it to your class Dropbox folder. If you are working with a partner, choose one person's Dropbox folder to use and then let me know where to look. Any feedback I give will show up automatically in the PDF in your Dropbox folder. If you submitted an initial draft, use the feedback to fix any problems that came up and re-submit the final draft similarly. 

If your initial draft has no significant issues with it, you will be given a score of 8/8 and no final draft submission is necessary. Otherwise, your work will not be given a grade yet. 

## Other portfolio guidelines
Here are some miscellaneous (but important!) guidelines for portfolio problems: 

- You do not need to work on the portfolio problems in order (Problem 1 followed by Problem 2 followed by Problem 3, etc.). In particular, if you have experience with AP Calculus in high school or otherwise have seen calculus before, you are allowed to work problems you believe you know how to solve even if we have not covered the material in class yet. 
- A "draft" is a good-faith effort at a complete and correct solution. **If you submit work that is deliberately incomplete or does not show sufficient effort, it will not be considered a "draft" and you will be asked to resubmit following additional work**. This includes work where you make it to a certain point and then stop because you "don't know where to go next". Note that this has implications for meeting deadlines (below). 
- **You may not submit more than three drafts during any given week**, where a "week" is defined to start and end at noon on Sunday. This includes initial and final drafts. 
- Also, **no initial drafts may be submitted during the last week of class (December 1--7)**. 

## Timetable
To ensure that you make timely progress on the portfolio during the semester and don't fall behind, a series of deadlines has been set up: 

- **By September 13 at 5pm**, submit at least one draft of one portfolio problem (this can be an initial draft). 
- **By September 20 at 5pm**, submit at least one final draft of one portfolio problem (presumably this will be a final draft of the problem you submitted before Sept 13) and an initial draft of a problem *other* than the one you submitted on Sept 13. 
- **By September 27 at 5pm**, submit one additional final draft (other than the one you submitted on Sept 20). If you make this deadline, you will have completed 1/4 of the portfolio during the first 1/3 of the semester. 
- **By October 18 at 5pm**, submit a total of at least four final drafts of portfolio problems. (Note that two of these need to have been submitted prior to Sept 27.)
- **By November 22 at 5pm**, submit a total of at least six final drafts of portfolio problems. (Note that four of these need to have been submitted prior to Sept 27.)

If you meet all these deadlines, you will have at most two remaining portfolio problems to complete as of the week of Thanksgiving. These should be completed at your own pace and submitted by the last day of classes, December 7 at 5pm. 

**Keep in mind that you may not submit more than three drafts (initial or final) during any given week and no initial drafts during the last week of class! Therefore procrastination doesn't work**. For example, if a student chose to miss all of the above deadlines and submit all eight problems during the last two weeks of class, at most only six of those problems would be graded. 

A good strategy to take with portfolio problems is that you should be submitting around two drafts each week on the average. If you can stick roughly to that schedule then you will be done well in advance of the end of the semester. It's possible to finish the entire portfolio as early as November 15 even if you have never seen the material in the class before; if you *have* seen the material before you could be done as early as the third week of the semester! 

**Final drafts that receive a grade of 0, 1 or 2 (see below) will not count toward meeting the above deadlines**. This is to prevent a deliberate submission of substandard work just to meet the deadline requirements. 

## Grading and sample solution writeups

Each Portfolio Problem will be graded on a scale from 0 to 8 according to the following rubric:

* 8: Solution has *no* mathematical errors, follows *all* guidelines in the Style Manual, and uses clear and convincing exposition. 
* 7: Solution has no mathematical errors and the exposition is clear and convincing, but contains a minor error (note the singular) in writing style.
* 6: Significant progress has been made toward a solution but the argument has one major mathematical error, or it is does not yet meet the writing guidelines.
* 4:  Some significant mathematical progress has been made towards a solution, but there are key errors in the mathematics or significant issues with the writing or style.
* 2: The solution shows evidence of at least one good idea, and an effort has been made to write a complete solution that conforms to the Style Manual.
* 0: Essentially no progress has been made towards a correct solution; or there are serious and/or numerous style errors (more than three mistakes involving grammar, spelling, or formatting as spelled out in the Style Manual). 
 
Grades of 1, 3, or 5 can also be assigned if the work is on the borderline between two categories.

To give you a sense of what an excellent writeup vs. a “just OK” writeup vs. a bad writeup look like, I’ve completed Exercise 1.1 from your textbook four different ways:

* Here is what an excellent (grade = 8) solution could look like.
* Here is what a good, but not excellent (grade = 6) solution that has no mathematical errors could look like.
* Here is what an acceptable, but significantly flawed (grade = 4) solution could look like.
* Here is what a poor (grade < 4) solution could look like, although there are many ways for a writeup to be poor.
* All of these writeups were done using the LaTeX typesetting software. We will discuss this and other options for document creation during the first week.

The Portfolio itself will consist of 74 points: 8 points for each of the 8 problems, and 2 points awarded for successfully meeting each of the five draft deadlines on September 13, September 20, September 27, October 18, and November 22.
