# MTH 201 Activity Plan 

This is assuming "Model 2B": 

- Class is in two groups (Red/Blue) 
- Every student has both a Red partner and a Blue partner 

Also assumes 12 modules, broken into A/B parts 

## Activities

- *Graded* Guided Practice for A module (Sunday) and B module (Tuesday) 
- *Graded for engagement credit* Active learning tasks done in F2F meetings for A module (MT) and B module (WR) -- can also be done asynchronously with extra tasks (due T and R evenings) 
- *Graded for engagement credit* Extension tasks done following MT/WR blocks 
- *Graded for engagement credit* Various activities done outside normal class structure to foster engagement 

Then also: 
- WeBWorK for basic practice - A/B/C sets of 5/5/5 questions each, often including at least one review question; due Wednesday/Friday/Sunday (15 * 12 = 180 points in all) 
- Skill Target assessments (???) 
- Final Exam 
- Application Problems
