Now let's look at how to work with functions when they're given as data, or tables. Functions in this format are very easy to work with, but they also have a lot of limitations. 

Here's a function given as a table that I pulled off of Wikipedia which shows the population of Grand Rapids, Michigan as a function of time -- specifically the year. I know this is a function because given a year within the scope of this function, I'm only ever going to get one population value and not two. 

Let's call the independent variable here c for the year of the census, and the dependent variable P for population. So the function represented on this table is P(c). 

To evaluate P(c), just take the year and look up the population. For example P(1910) was 112,571. Likewise P(2010) was 188,040. That's just about all you need to know about functions given as table. It's actually worth pointing out what we *don't* know from this table, though. 

Unlike a formula where we can plug in all kinds of numbers and do the math to get output and unlike a graph where you can evaluate the function at many points, a table can only be evaluated at the points that are in the table. We can only work with the data we have. At all other points, the function doesn't exist. 

For example if I wanted to find P(2005), there's no table entry for c = 2015 because there was no census in that year. So I'd have to say that P(2005) doesn't exist. I have no actual data for it. I could perhaps estimate it, for example by averaging P(2000) and P(2010), but this will just be an educated guess and not actual data that we collected. Estimations like this make assumptions about our data that might not be true, for example that the negative growth between 2000 and 2010 was fairly even --  but this might not be the case, there could have been a huge dropoff from 2000 to 2001 and then it was all uphill from there. Doing accurate estimations, as any weather forecaster can tell you, is part science and part art, and the science part involves some sophisticated math to get estimates that have as little error as possible. In fact one application of calculus is to devise such high-accuracy estimation techniques based on the subtle changes in the actual data that we collected. 

Anyway, now you know how to evaluate a function given as data, and how to know what it does and does not tell you. Thanks for watching.
