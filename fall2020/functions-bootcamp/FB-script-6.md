Now that we've seen how to work with functions in different representations, let's look at how we can create new functions by taking ones we already have and combining them in different ways. 

One way to combine functions is by doing arithmetic with them -- adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing them --- like we do with individual numbers. An example of when we might do this in real life is when you have a portfolio of funds for retirement. Let's say one source of money for your account comes from the stock market, and another comes from money that you save from a regular paycheck. If this table gives you the earnings of your stocks as a function of time, and this table gives you how much you earn each paycheck, then to find the total value of your retirement savings at any time, you'd look up the individual values at that time and add them together. We could do this for all the time values that we have data for, and create a new table which is actually a new function that's defined by evaluating the other two functions and adding them. 

So as a general rule: If f(x) and g(x) are two functions with the same independent variable (x), then 

(f+g)(x) is the function we get by finding f(x) and g(x) and adding the results. Similarly
(f-g)(x) we get by subtracting the results of f(x) and g(x), 
(f*g)(x) we get by multiplying the results of f(x) and g(x), and 
(f/g)(x) we get by dividing the results of f(x) and g(x). 

Let's look at some examples. 

Let's let f(t) = t^2(t-1) and g(t) is the function given by this graph. 
g\left(t\right)=\sin\left(\pi t\right)+\frac{1}{2}t

First: Let's compute (f+g)(3). This means: find f(3), then find g(3) and then add the results. Well, f(3) we get by taking the formula and replacing all instances of t with 3, then doing the math. So we get f(3) = 3^2(3-1) which is 9 times 2, or 18. g(3) we get by looking up the height of the graph, and it appears that g(3) = 3/2. So (f+g)(3) is 18 + 3/2 or 39/2 which as a decimal is 19.5. 

Next, let's find (g-f)(2). We need to find g(2), then f(2), then subtract. From the graph, g(2) is 1. And from the formula, f(2) is 2^2(2-1) which is 4. So (g-f)(2) is 1 - 4 which is -3. 

Next, let's (4f*g)(3). We saw above that f(3) = 18 and g(3) = 3/2. So (4fg)(3) is 4 times 18 times 3/2, which is 108. 

Lastly, let's combine in a really weird way and find (f/g^2)(4). I need to find f(4) first. That's f(4) = 4^2(4-1) or 16(3) which is 48. Now I need to find g(4) which appears to be 2. I also need to square g(4) so that's 4. Finally (f/g^2)(4) would be 48 divided 4, which is 12. 

Note that in this example it doesn't matter that f(t) and g(t) are in two different representations. To evaluate these combinations, I just need to be able to evaluate the functions within the combination, whether that means plugging something into a formula or reading off a graph or table. 

Thanks for watching.
