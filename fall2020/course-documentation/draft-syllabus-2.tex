\subsection{START HERE}\label{start-here}}

\textbf{Welcome to Calculus}! I'm Robert Talbert, a professor in the
Mathematics Department, and I am grateful that you are signed up for the
course and am looking forward to working with you this semester.

Before reading any further, here are some first things to know:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{My highest priority this semester is your success in this
  course.} I am committed to helping you be successful in MTH 201 this
  semester. ``Success'' in the course is more than just good grades. It
  means that you are being \textbf{challenged} to grow as a learner,
  that you are \textbf{engaging actively} with tasks that feed your
  growth, and that you are creating \textbf{excellent work} in
  mathematics by completing challenging Calculus-related tasks with a
  appropriate level of support. It also means that you are
  \textbf{building your lifelong learning skills} so that once the
  course is over, you are better and stronger as a learner and can
  continue to \textbf{learn new things independently}, and especially go
  on to \textbf{success in courses that have MTH 201 as a prerequisite}.
\item
  \textbf{College level mathematics is more than just computation.} On
  the pathway to ``success'' as outlined above, you will be asked to do
  more than just perform computations. You will be working on
  \textbf{explaining the meaning} of mathematical processes and results
  in oral and written forms to different audiences; \textbf{working on
  realistic applications} of basic skills to authentic problems;
  \textbf{extending basic ideas} to more advanced concepts; and
  \textbf{seeking true understanding} of underlying concepts. In fact,
  many of the computations you might do with algebra in high school
  level mathematics will be automated through computers in MTH 201, and
  your work will mostly focus on these higher-level tasks.
\item
  \textbf{You can expect to be challenged intellectually throughout this
  course.} None of these elements of ``success'' come easily. They
  require dedicated devotion of time and energy to wrestling with the
  concepts and tasks in the course. This will require you to leave your
  comfort zones on a regular basis. You may find that you need to rewire
  your entire process for learning things. You will need to stay
  constantly engaged with the course through participation in class
  meetings and on the class discussion board --- asking questions,
  seeking understanding, and giving help.\\
\item
  \textbf{Intellectual struggle is normal and healthy in a challenging
  course.} Since none of this is easy, you can expect at times to feel
  like you are really struggling with the material --- even if in your
  earlier math courses you might never have experienced struggle.
  \textbf{This is a normal and healthy experience.} When you are
  building physical muscles, the point at which you are growing the most
  is the moment you experience the greatest strain and fatigue.
  Legitimate struggle is actually a sign you are doing things right, and
  it's a signal you're about to experience explosive growth. \textbf{Our
  class is a safe place for you to experience those struggles.}
\item
  \textbf{You have a lot of help available to you as you work.}
  Throughout the semester, you will be challenged but also given a lot
  of support to help you rise to the challenge. I will be readily
  available to help in several channels; your classmates will be
  available for help through structured and informal support groups; and
  the GVSU Math Department provides free help through the Math Center.
  \textbf{Everyone in the course has your back.}
\item
  \textbf{You will find MTH 201 to be very enjoyable if you embrace the
  challenge.} Although hard work doesn't always feel good in the moment,
  by embracing the challenge and committing to learning Calculus, I
  think you will find that \textbf{growth is fun} and \textbf{Calculus
  is really interesting stuff}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{course-information}{%
\subsection{Course information}\label{course-information}}

\textbf{Instructor}: Robert Talbert, Ph.D., Professor of Mathematics.
Email: talbertr@gvsu.edu. Phone: ???

\textbf{Office and office hours:} My office is \textbf{Mackinac Hall
C-2-513}; however to promote good public health, \textbf{all student
meetings this semester will be conducted remotely unless you have a
specific need that requires a physical meeting outside of class}. Open
drop-in hours will be held online \textbf{Monday through Thursday,
1-1:50pm}, using the link \url{http://gvsu.edu/s/1qX} and password
\textbf{growthmind}. \textbf{You do not need an appointment for open
drop-in hours.} (You may be put into a waiting room if there is a
meeting in process.) If you cannot attend open drop-in hours, you can
contact me by email, through a Campuswire direct message, or by
scheduling an appointment at http://rtalbert.youcanbook.me.

\textbf{Availability:} Please note that \textbf{I typically only check
email and other messages between 6am and 6pm on weekdays and once on
Saturday mornings}. If you send a message that needs a response during
those times, \emph{you can expect to get a response within 6 hours}.
Otherwise you can expect one when I am back online. Please plan
accordingly --- for example, do not send messages after 6pm with the
expectation of an immediate response. \textbf{If you have a question and
it can be made public, you'll get a much faster response if you post it
to CampusWire instead}.

\textbf{Face-to-face Meetings}: This course is being conducted in a
\emph{staggered hybrid} mode in which your section is split into two
groups, called the ``Red'' group and the ``Blue'' group, and the
different groups take turns meeting face-to-face (F2F) and working
online. The time and location of your F2F meetings depends on your
section and group:

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\textbf{Textbook:} We will use \emph{Active Calculus} (2018 edition) by
Matt Boelkins. The textbook is freely available online at
https://activecalculus.org/single/frontmatter.html. \textbf{This online
version is preferred.} There is also a PDF version available, and
instructions for ordering a printed copy, at
https://activecalculus.org/.

\textbf{Course website and discussion board:} All course announcements,
assignments, and grades will be communicated using the course
\textbf{Blackboard} site available at http://mybb.gvsu.edu. All other
course communications (including additional examples, guidance on
assignments, etc.) will be available through \textbf{Campuswire}, our
class discussion tool; to join, go to https://campuswire.com/p/GAD2DF67E
and join with the code \texttt{7913}.

\textbf{Course calendar:} A Google Calendar for the course, will all due
dates and other important time-sensitive information posted on it, is
available on Blackboard through a link in the left sidebar. \textbf{Be
sure to check the calendar once daily} for upcoming events. The calendar
is kept up-to-date constantly and \textbf{in cases of apparent conflicts
in times or dates, the calendar is considered to be correct always.}

\textbf{Technology:} To use the course tools, you will need to have
access to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{A laptop or tablet device}, preferably one with a
  \textbf{touchscreen that allows writing on the screen with a stylus}.
  Please plan on bringing this device with you to all F2F meetings.
\item
  \textbf{A modern web browser}. Chrome is preferred, but browsers such
  as Firefox and Edge are also fine.
\item
  \textbf{Reliable access to high-speed internet}.
\item
  \textbf{An active GVSU network account} so that you can access email,
  Blackboard, and Google Docs.
\end{itemize}

If you have any issue with accessing any of the above, please let me
know as soon as possible. We will use a variety of additional course
tools during the semester, but they will be free to use, and you will be
taught how to use them as part of the class.

\textbf{What Calculus is about:} Calculus is the mathematical study of
\textbf{change}. Quite frequently we care not only about \emph{how much}
there is of a certain quantity but \emph{how fast it is changing} at a
given point in time. Case in point: The current Covid-19 pandemic. The
number of Covid-19 cases in the USA is important, but at least as
important is the rate at which that number is growing or shrinking right
now. Calculus starts with simple geometry and introduces the important
concept of the \emph{limit} to develop an entire language, focused on
the \emph{derivative} and the \emph{definite integral}, that allows us
to describe and calculate change.

\textbf{Course content:} We will cover chapters 1-4 of the \emph{Active
Calculus} text. Key topics to be studied include: understanding
functions from the perspective of calculus, the concept of limit, the
definition and meaning of the derivative, computing derivatives, using
derivatives in applications, antiderivatives and definite integrals and
their meaning, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In every topic,
we seek a \textbf{conceptual understanding} from several perspectives,
the ability to \textbf{apply ideas}, development of \textbf{logical
reasoning and communication skills}, and an \textbf{appreciation for
calculus as a whole}.

\textbf{Official course description:} A development of the fundamental
concepts of calculus using graphical, numerical, and analytical methods
with algebraic and trigonometric functions of a single variable. Limits
and continuity, derivatives, indefinite integrals, definite integrals,
and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus; applications of derivatives and
integrals. Fulfills Foundations - Mathematical Sciences. Offered every
semester. \emph{Prerequisites}: MTH 122 and MTH 123; or MTH 124; or
assignment through Grand Valley math placement.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use \textbf{functions} and other pre-Calculus mathematics
  proficiently.
\item
  Calculate, use, and explain the concept of \textbf{limits}.
\item
  Explain and interpret the meaning of the \textbf{derivative} of a
  function.
\item
  Use \textbf{shortcuts} to calculate derivatives efficiently.
\item
  Use derivatives to solve authentic real-life \textbf{application
  problems}.
\item
  Use \textbf{definite integrals and the Fundamental Theorem of
  Calculus} to find areas and total change.
\end{itemize}

A full list of official departmental objectives for MTH 201 can be found
\href{https://www.gvsu.edu/cms4/asset/9A420BCF-BA9E-0845-91754145EA82C51F/sor_descriptions_objectives__topics_for_faculty_updated_12-11-19.pdf}{here}.

Your progress toward these course objectives will be tracked using
\textbf{Learning Targets}. There are 22 individual Learning Targets
covering all the major skills in the course; a complete list of these is
at the end of this syllabus. Your grade in the course will be based in
large part on the amount and quality of evidence you can provide,
through various forms of work, that you've mastered these Learning
Targets.

\hypertarget{structure-and-flow-of-the-course}{%
\subsection{Structure and flow of the
course}\label{structure-and-flow-of-the-course}}

Your MTH 201 course is being offered in a \textbf{staggered hybrid}
mode. ``Staggered'' means that while we will have F2F meetings
regularly, we will stagger the attendance so that only about half the
section is in attendance at any given meeting, for social distancing
purposes. ``Hybrid'' means that the course is a combination of F2F work
and asynchronous online work, with about a 50/50 split in our case. The
content of MTH 201 is divided into 12 \textbf{modules}, each of which is
subdivided into a ``Part A'' and a ``Part B''. A complete list of
modules and the content they cover is in the Appendix at the end of this
syllabus.

Your work in the class will follow a simple, repeating pattern that will
involve you \textbf{before}, \textbf{during}, and \textbf{after} our
meetings. It works like this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{BEFORE each class}: You'll complete a \textbf{Daily Prep}
  assignment in which you'll get familiar with the \textbf{basic
  concepts} of the upcoming lesson through guided reading, video, or
  hands-on activity and completion of basic exercises on new concepts.
  Daily Prep assignments will typically be due by 11:59pm ET the night
  before the lesson; you'll be able to work ahead if you want.
\item
  \textbf{DURING each clas}s: Class meetings will typically start with
  10 minutes for going over the Daily Prep assignments and fielding your
  questions. Then we will spend most of the class (around 30 minutes)
  doing activities together on the harder concepts from the material.
  There may be some small lectures, but active work will be the main
  event since you can only learn math by doing it! Then we will
  typically spend 10 minutes wrapping up, going through some of the main
  points of the activity, taking short ungraded quizzes to give you
  feedback on your learning, and then getting your feedback on the
  lesson.
\item
  \textbf{AFTER each class}: In the hybrid format, only about half the
  lesson is covered during the in-class session. The rest of the lesson
  is learned through \textbf{Followup Activities} that you will do
  asynchronously (outside of class on your own schedule). Followup
  activities are basically what we \emph{would} do as active group work
  if we were going to meet for a second hour on the lesson.
\end{itemize}

This pattern repeats for each F2F meeting that you have with your group.

Finally, there is ongoing work that you'll be doing outside the flow of
class meetings: Online homework done weekly to practice the ideas from
the module, Application/Extension Problems that take your basic skills
to the next level and into real-world applications, and Checkpoints
given roughly every other week that assess your mastery of basic skills.
More on these in the ``Learning Activities in MTH 201'' section below.

Visually, the workflow looks like this:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{201workflow.png}
\caption{201 Workflow}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Live streaming of F2F meetings:} All F2F meetings will be
live-streamed. If you cannot attend one of your designated F2F meetings,
you will have the option of participating remotely through the live
stream, and you do not need to get prior permission or provide a reason
to do so.

\hypertarget{learning-activities-in-mth-201}{%
\subsection{Learning activities in MTH
201}\label{learning-activities-in-mth-201}}

You will be engaging with several different kinds of activities in the
course, both to learn the material and to demonstrate how well you have
learned it. Our course uses a \textbf{mastery grading} system in which
\textbf{most graded items do not use points}, but rather your work will
be required to meet certain levels of quality that demonstrate
\emph{mastery}. We will discuss this several times in class, and there
is more information later in this document.

The kinds of activities you will undertake are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Daily Preparation (DP)}: You will complete these before each
  of your F2F meetings. Each Daily Prep assignment involves reading,
  video-watching, or interaction and then working exercises on basic
  learning obejctives. Each Daily Prep is graded with a ``check'' if it
  is submitted by the deadline (given on the course calendar), every
  exercise has a response, and each response indicates a good-faith
  effort to be right. Otherwise the work receives an ``x''.
\item
  \textbf{Followup Activities (FA)}: Followup activities will complete
  the lesson for each part of a module and are done after a F2F meeting.
  As with Daily Prep assignments, they are grade with a ``check'' if the
  activity is completed by the due date and each part of the activity is
  complete with a good-faith effort to be right. Otherwise it receives
  an ``x''.\\
\item
  \textbf{WeBWorK (WW)}: Once a week, you will complete a 16-item online
  homework set that provides practice on basic ideas from each part of a
  module. These are deployed using the \emph{WeBWorK} online homework
  system at https://webwork-math.gvsu.edu/webwork2/. These will
  typically be due Sunday nights at 11:59pm ET. WeBWork allows for
  unlimited multiple attempts without penalty up to those deadlines.
  Each WeBWorK item is worth 1 point (some allow partial credit) and is
  auto-graded by the computer on the basis of correctness of the answer.
\item
  \textbf{Learning Target Checkpoints}: On a roughly bi-weekly basis,
  you'll receive a take-home exam called a ``Checkpoint''. Each
  Checkpoint will contain one problem for every Learning Target that has
  been covered up to that point. For example, Checkpoint 1 will contain
  problems for the first 2-3 Learning Targets; Checkpoint 2 will contain
  new versions of those problems plus new problems for the next 2-3
  Learning Targets; Checkpoint 3 will contain new versions of all the
  old Learning Targets plus new problems for the next 2-3 Learning
  Targets, and so on. You'll be given a detailed rubric explaining what
  constitutes acceptable work on each Learning Target. Work that meets
  the criteria for acceptable work will be given a ``check''; work that
  does not meet the criteria will receive an ``X''. If you receive an
  ``x'' on a problem, you can try it again on a new version on the next
  Checkpoint until you receive a ``check''. You will only need to
  attempt problems on Learning Targets you have not yet mastered. You
  can also earn a ``check'' through means other than Checkpoints; see
  ``How work is graded in MTH 201'' below for details.
\item
  \textbf{Application/Extension Problems (AEPs)}: AEPs are more
  extensive problems that require applying or extending the basic course
  knowledge from the Learning Targets. There will be at least 8 AEP sets
  posted during the semester, graded using the EMRN rubric discussed in
  ``How work is graded in MTH 201'' and can be revised and resubmitted
  if needed.
\item
  \textbf{Final Exam}: The final exam in the course will consist of two
  parts. The first part consists of big-picture questions on the overall
  ideas of the course. Your performance on this part contributes to the
  plus/minus grade in the course. The other part of the final exam will
  be a last Checkpoint of the semester and will give you the chance to
  meet additional learning targets that have not yet been mastered.
\item
  \textbf{Miscellaneous engagement opportunities}: Various other
  activities in the class will give you the opportunity to get and stay
  engaged with the course. These include the Startup assignment in week
  1, occasional discussion board activities, meeting certain incentive
  bonus deadlines, and other items. Designated items will carry 1
  ``engagement credit'', and engagement credits will accumulate through
  the semester. In particular, every ``check'' on a Daily Prep and
  Followup activity is worth 1 engagement credit.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, you'll be required to complete some basic review of
mathematical functions in order to make sure you're prepared to start
work with Calculus. This review is called the \textbf{Functions
Bootcamp} and your completion of the bootcamp will come through either a
special WeBWorK set or a take-home assessment. More information on this
will be given in week 1.

\hypertarget{how-work-is-graded-in-mth-201}{%
\subsection{How work is graded in MTH
201}\label{how-work-is-graded-in-mth-201}}

\hypertarget{proficiency-and-mastery-on-learning-targets}{%
\subsubsection{Proficiency and Mastery on Learning
Targets}\label{proficiency-and-mastery-on-learning-targets}}

There are 23 Learning Targets in the course, 11 of which are designated
as \textbf{Core} targets due to their central nature in Calculus, and
the other 12 of which are designated as \textbf{Supplemental}. There are
two levels of achievement on any of the Learning Targets:
\textbf{Proficiency} and \textbf{Mastery}. Students get numerous
opportunities to demonstrate understanding of the Learning Targets;
every time this happens, the student receives a ``check'' on that
Learning Target.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To be rated as ``Proficient'' on a Learning Target, earn \textbf{one
  check} on it.
\item
  To be rated as ``Mastered'' on a Learning Target, earn \textbf{two
  checks} on it.
\end{itemize}

You can earn a check on a Learning Target in four different ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{(The simplest way)} \textbf{Do work on a Checkpoint} that meets
  the criteria for acceptable quality, as described above.
\item
  \textbf{Schedule an oral assessment} (on videoconference) during which
  I will give a new version of a Checkpoint-like problem for that
  Learning Target, and you solve that problem ``live'' at an acceptable
  level.
\item
  \textbf{Create a video} of yourself working out the solution to a
  Checkpoint-like problem that I will make for you, then submit the
  video. If you choose this option, you'll also be required to have a
  follow-up video meeting with me to discuss the solution and answer
  additional related questions to make sure you really understand the
  ideas.
\item
  \textbf{Use work on an AEP set} and schedule a videoconference meeting
  with me to argue that your work on the AEP demonstrates mastery of the
  Learning Target, as well as answer follow-up questions. For example,
  you might do work on an AEP that you believe demonstrates proficiency
  with ``computing derivatives correctly using multiple rules in
  combination'' (Learning Target DC.3). If so, then you could schedule a
  meeting with me to explain why you think your work satisfied DC.3; I
  would listen and, if I agree, I might ask you to work out a second
  problem also related to DC.3 to make sure you really understand the
  idea.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Boundaries on these methods:} Please note the following
restrictions on options 2-4 above:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{No more than one check per week can be earned through options
  2-4}.
\item
  \emph{Option 3 (make a video) must adhere to standards for video
  creation} (to be posted separately; basically the video must have
  clear sound and audio, and keep face, handwriting, and voice in the
  frame at all times).
\item
  \emph{Mastery (two checks) }must* include at least one Checkpoint
  problem*. That is, you can't earn Mastery on a learning target through
  options 2-4 alone.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, for example, you can earn Mastery (two checks) on a Learning
Target by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Earning a check on a Checkpoint problem for that target, then earning
  another on a new version of that problem on a later Checkpoint;
\item
  Earning a check on a Checkpoint problem for that target; then earning
  another check through an oral assessment;
\item
  Doing a video on that target, then earning a check on a Checkpoint;
\item
  Discussing some AEP work related to that target, then earning a check
  on a Checkpoint
\end{itemize}

But you cannot earn Mastery, for instance, by doing a video and then
using an AEP. At least one of the checks has to come through a
Checkpoint.

\textbf{Exceptions:} Learning Target F.1 is assessed \emph{only} through
the \textbf{Functions Bootcamp} assignment given in the first 2-3 weeks
of classes. This assignment consists of a special WeBWorK set. A score
of 75\% or higher will earn \emph{Proficiency} rating on this target; a
score of 90\% or higher will earn \emph{Mastery}. A second Functions
Bootcamp set will be given around week 7 for those who do not earn
Mastery on the first set. Further, Learning Target L.2 (L'Hopital's
Rule) will be assessed through a special AEP set and will not appear on
a Checkpoint; an ``E'' on that AEP will count as Mastery, an ``M'' as
Proficiency.

\hypertarget{the-emrn-rubric}{%
\subsubsection{The EMRN rubric}\label{the-emrn-rubric}}

Work on Application/Extension Problems is graded not with points but
with one of four designation: ``E'' (Excellent/Exemplary), ``M'' (Meets
the standard), ``R'' (Needs revision), or ``N'' (Not assessible/Not
enough information). The process of assigning these marks is shown
below:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{EMRN.png}
\caption{EMRN rubric}
\end{figure}

Whenever your work on an AEP is graded, you will be given extensive
actionable feedback on what was done well and what needs improvement.

\hypertarget{how-your-semester-grade-is-determined}{%
\subsubsection{How your semester grade is
determined}\label{how-your-semester-grade-is-determined}}

Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to earn
a particular letter grade, each requirement must be met in the column
for that grade. Your \emph{base grade} (the letter A,B,C, D, or F
without plus or minus) is \textbf{the highest grade for which all the
requirements are met}.

Note: In the table, numerical values indicate the minimum level needed
to meet the requirement; amounts above this level also meet the
requirement. For AEP's, ``M+'' means ``either M or E''. Finally,
``DP+LA'' refers to the \emph{sum} of your Daily Prep and Followup
Activities with a ``check''; there will be 24 of each, for a maximum
total of 48.

A grade of ``F'' is given if not all the requirements for a ``D'' are
met.

\textbf{Plus/minus grades:} Your base grade may be modified with a plus
or minus, according to these guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A ``plus'' is added to the base grade if all requirements for a base
  grade are satisfied, \emph{and} the LT (both the Core and
  Supplemental) \emph{or} AEP requirement for the next level up is also
  satisfied; \emph{and} the big-picture portion of the final exam is
  passed.
\item
  A ``minus'' is added to the base grade above in any of the following
  cases: (1) All requirements for a base grade are satisfied
  \emph{except one}, and that one is no more than two levels below the
  others; \textbf{or} (2) You meet the minimum requirements for a base
  grade (i.e.~none of the requirements for higher levels are met) and
  you do not pass the big-picture portion of the final exam. In the
  first case, if the deficient area is more than two levels below, the
  penalty will be either a minus or a full letter grade, at my
  discretion.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{revisions-and-tokens}{%
\subsection{Revisions and tokens}\label{revisions-and-tokens}}

Since your work in the course is not graded with points (or is graded
either 0 or 1), partial credit is not available except for occasional
multi-part WeBWorK items. Instead, almost all work you do in the course
can be revised and resubmitted to allow you to improve your work and
raise your grade.

\textbf{Checkpoint items} can be revised by reattempting the item on a
later Checkpoint or through one of the other means described earlier.
For example if you attempt a Checkpoint problem for Learning Target D.1
and receive an ``x'', you can: redo the problem on a later Checkpoint
(where it will be the same essential task but with different specifics);
schedule an oral exam via video meeting to attempt a different version
of the problem; create a video for a different version of the problem;
or use work on an AEP to argue that you've met the standards for that
target. Remember, though, only one check per week can be earned through
non-Checkpoint methods, and Mastery level on a target requires that at
least one Checkpoint problem earn a ``check''.

\textbf{AEPs} earning M, R, or N can be revised and resubmitted at any
time. They will be regraded using the same standards as originally used.
However, there are two important limitations on your revision and
resubmission of AEP's:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Two-submission-per-week rule: No more than two submissions of
AEP sets may be made per week. This can be two new sets, two revisions,
or one of each.} A third submission can be purchased with a token
(below) but \textbf{four or more submissions in a week are not allowed
under any cirumstance.}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Revision of N grades rule: Students have to spend a token
(below) in order to revise any AEP that was graded at ``N'' (Not
Assessable).}
\end{quote}

\textbf{WeBWorK} items can be redone and resubmitted as many times as
you want until the deadline, at no cost.

However, \textbf{Daily Prep} and \textbf{Followup Activities} may not be
revised at all; these are graded on the basis of completeness and effort
only and are intended to be done once.

\hypertarget{tokens}{%
\subsubsection{Tokens}\label{tokens}}

Tokens are a fake currency that are used to ``purchase'' exceptions to
course policies and other advantageous items in the course. Every
student starts with five of these. One token can be spent for any of the
following at any time:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Attempt a second Learning Target in a given week through
  non-Checkpoint means\\
\item
  Submit a third AEP (either revision or new submission) in a given week
\item
  Revise an AEP graded ``N''
\item
  Extend the deadline on a Checkpoint by 12 hours (request must be
  submitted prior to the original deadline)
\item
  Extend the deadline on a WeBWorK set by 24 hours (request must be
  submitted prior to the original deadline)
\item
  Purchase 3 engagement credits
\end{itemize}

To spend a token, please use the \emph{Token Spending form} found on
Blackboard in the left sidebar.

With the exception of the last item, tokens may not be ``stacked'', for
example by spending 3 tokens to get a 72-hour WeBWorK deadline
extension. You can stack tokens to purchase engagement credits
(e.g.~spend 3 to get 9 EC's).

Opportunities to earn more tokens may be given during the semester.

\hypertarget{academic-integrity-in-mth-201}{%
\subsection{Academic integrity in MTH
201}\label{academic-integrity-in-mth-201}}

The university's academic integrity policy is described in the GVSU
Student Code, Section 3.1 which you can read online here:
\url{http://bit.ly/gvsuacademicintegrity}. \textbf{Every student has the
responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially
the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest activities.}

Some of the work you will do in the course involves collaboration; at
other times collaboration may be allowed but not required; while at
others it may not be allowed. Here are the rules for collaboration on
each kind of work you do:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Daily Prep and Followup Activities}: You may collaborate with
  others, but your writeup must be in your own words. You may not copy
  someone's work and submit it as your own, nor may you copy the ideas
  from someone and simply change the wording.
\item
  \emph{Checkpoints} and other work done on Learning Targets: No
  interations at all with another person or with unauthorized sources on
  the internet is allowed. Any evidence of using information from
  another person or source will be investigated as academic dishonesty.
\item
  \emph{AEPs}: Similarly, no interations at all with another person or
  with unauthorized sources on the internet is allowed.
\item
  \emph{WeBWorK}: You may discuss the general, broad ideas of WeBWorK
  problems with others (including on Campuswire) but you may not use
  other people's work as your own. You may also not ask for specific
  details of a solution, either in person or on Campuswire.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{In particular, use of ``study'' sites such as Chegg or
Coursehero, or Q\&A sites like Stack Exchange or Quora, to obtain help
on graded work other than Daily Prep or Followups is forbidden and will
automatically constitute academic dishonesty.}

All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be thoroughly
investigated, and whether a student has committed academic dishonesty is
my determination to make based on the evidence. If I determine academic
dishonesty has been committed, a report will be filed with the Dean of
Students office, and the minimum penalty will be:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Daily Prep and Followup: A grade of ``x''
\item
  Checkpoints and other Learning Target work: A grade of ``x'' and
  required expense of two tokens to reattempt; for severe cases, you may
  be barred from reattempting.
\item
  AEP's: A grade of ``N'', and you will not be allowed to revise or
  resubmit the AEP for the rest of the semester.
\item
  WeBWorK: A ``0'' on the entire WeBWorK set.
\end{itemize}

Note these are \emph{minimum} penalties; additional penalties may be
given including reduction of course grades and potential suspension from
the university.

\textbf{Please note: There is no need to commit academic dishonesty in
this class since you can revise and resubmit almost anything.} If you
come to believe that cheating or plagiarism is necessary given your
situation: DON'T DO IT. Get some help instead and take comfort in the
fact that you can just submit your best effort, get feedback, and try
again later.

\hypertarget{additional-course-expectations-and-information}{%
\subsection{Additional course expectations and
information}\label{additional-course-expectations-and-information}}

Below are some additional important information about the course. Please
note there is a separate section following this one, with course
policies specific to the Covid-19 pandemic and how the class will be
conducted.

\textbf{Attendance:} Each F2F meeting will be live-streamed so that you
can participate either F2F or remotely. It is critical that you actually
attend your group's F2F meeting days --- Monday/Wednesday for Red group
and Tuesday/Thursday for Blue group --- either F2F or synchronously
online. \textbf{You may not attend the F2F meeting for the group other
than your own} due to social distancing requirements; however you are
welcome to watch the live stream of the other group's meeting if you
want.

You will be responsible for all announcements made in the F2F meetings
and for all material covered in those meetings. Each meeting will begin
on the hour; please be on time for your meetings. If circumstances
beyond your control prevent you from attending F2F \emph{or}
participating remotely, please let me know so I can help you stay
current.

\textbf{Tech support:} Please note that \textbf{I (Prof.~Talbert) am not
able to provide support for technological issues}. If you encounter
issues with technology, please use the appropriate source of help:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{For help with Blackboard}: Email the Blackboard Help Desk at
  bbadmin@gvsu.edu or call (616) 331-8526. For hours of operation and
  more information see https://www.gvsu.edu/elearn/help/.
\item
  \emph{For help with the GVSU network, email, or printing}: Email the
  GVSU IT Help Desk at helpdesk@gvsu.edu; or call (616) 331-2101 or toll
  free (855) 435-7488. For hours of operation and more information see
  https://www.gvsu.edu/it/.
\item
  \emph{For specific help with your computer}: Try the GVSU IT Help Desk
  (see previous bullet) or contact your equipment manufacturer or
  computer store.
\item
  \emph{For help with course tools such as Desmos and Campuswire}: Ask a
  question on the \texttt{\#tech} channel on Campuswire, seek out the
  help documentation in the tool, or do a targeted Google search.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Deadlines and late work:} Deadlines for course work are clearly
indicated on the Course Calendar; in cases of apparent conflict between
dates, always assume that the Course Calendar is right.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{For Daily Prep and Followup Activities}: No extensions to
  deadlines are available. Simply submit a good faith effort on all
  items by the deadline.
\item
  \emph{For Checkpoints and WeBWorK sets}: Deadlines may be extended 12
  and 24 hours, respectively, by spending a token. No other extensions
  are available.
\item
  \emph{For AEPs}: There is only one deadline for AEP's, namely the last
  day of classes (11:59pm ET, Friday December 11). Otherwise you simply
  submit your work when it is ready to be graded (subject to the
  Two-Item-Per-Week Rule). This deadline will not be extended.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Math Center:} GVSU's Math Tutoring Center is online with
Blackboard Collaborate this semester! You can access virtual drop-in
tutoring through a link in your Blackboard course called Math Tutoring
Center or on our website at http://gvsu.edu/tutoring/math/. Then you
need to click on the ``Online Math Tutoring Center'' button, which will
require a GVSU login. There will be tutors online, ready to help, Monday
through Thursday 10a -- 9p, Friday 10a -- 2p and Sunday 6p -- 9p
starting Wednesday, September 2nd. Bring questions about your
technology, on methods and concepts, or on specific problems. All Math
Center tutoring is FREE, so stop by early and often. When you enter the
Collaborate room, please type your first and last name so you can get
you signed in and connected with a tutor.

\textbf{Special learning needs:} If you have special needs because of
learning, physical or other disabilities, it is your responsibility to
contact Disability Support Resources (DSR) at 616-331-2490 or
http://www.gvsu.edu/dsr/ . DSR will help you arrange accommodations.
Then, speak with me in person about making those accommodations and
ensure that they are consistent with your arrangements with DSR.

\textbf{Basic needs security:} If you have difficulty affording
groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack
a safe and stable place to live, I encourage you to visit
\href{https://www.gvsu.edu/replenish/}{Replenish}, a food resource for
GVSU students. If you are comfortable doing so, please speak with me
about your circumstances so that I can advocate for you and to connect
you with other campus resources.

\textbf{Gender identity and expression:} If, for purposes of gender
identity and expression, your official name (in Banner) does not match
your preferred name, your name can be updated in Blackboard. Please
contact the registrar's office to submit this request. The registrar's
office will contact the Blackboard administrator to make the change and
will also contact your professors to inform them that your name in
Banner will not match the name in Blackboard.

\textbf{Changes to this syllabus:} Changes to this syllabus may occur
during the semester. In those cases, the changes will be announced in
class and online, and if appropriate, students will be given a voice on
how the changes will be implemented. It is your responsibility stay
abreast of the information passed along in course announcements so that
you will be aware of any changes that take place.

\textbf{Credits:} Portions of the language of this syllabus were adapted
from the syllabi of Prof.~Matt Boelkins and Prof.~David Clark, both of
GVSU.

\hypertarget{mth-201-covid-19-policies}{%
\subsection{MTH 201 COVID-19 Policies}\label{mth-201-covid-19-policies}}

As you are well aware, we will be having class this semester while
trying to navigate a global pandemic that seems to change every day.
While we can't predict even the near future, the following are general
guidelines and plans for how we can work productively together in the
course.

\hypertarget{taking-care-of-yourself}{%
\subsubsection{Taking care of yourself}\label{taking-care-of-yourself}}

Above all else, \textbf{take care of your own physical and mental
health} during these difficult times. Make sure you are getting
sufficient rest, staying connected to friends and family, and giving
yourself time and space to do things you enjoy outside of college.
\href{https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/self-care-tips-during-the-covid-19-pandemic}{This
website lists several good tips} for maintaining good self-care in our
situation.

Before coming to campus, \textbf{perform a self-evaluation each time}
and \textbf{if you feel even the slightest bit of sickness or Covid-19
symptoms, stay home and participate remotely}. You should be on campus
only if you feel \emph{completely healthy}.

Please know that \textbf{at any time this semester if you feel unable or
unwilling to be present for a F2F meeting, you can opt out of the
meeting and participate remotely --- no questions asked, no permission
needed, no penalty incurred}. Remember that F2F meetings are
live-streamed, and you can participate remotely through Campuswire and
other means, so you will not fall behind if you have to participate from
home. Also note that \emph{there are no graded assessments done in
class} so you will never have to make up work that was turned in during
class.

\hypertarget{keeping-our-class-meetings-safe}{%
\subsubsection{Keeping our class meetings
safe}\label{keeping-our-class-meetings-safe}}

When you are present in a F2F meeting, please observe the following:

\textbf{Wear a mask at all times.} Face coverings, such as masks, are
required to be worn in the classroom. Students who have forgotten their
face coverings may get a disposable mask at a campus office. The
evidence is clear that
\href{https://www.wbtv.com/2020/06/29/demonstration-aims-show-effectiveness-masks/}{face
coverings are a crucial part of keeping coronavirus at bay} and
\href{https://www.gvsu.edu/inclusion/suggested-syllabus-language-for-inclusion-and-equity-132.htm}{support
the university's commitment to providing all members of its community
with an inclusive living and learning environment with equitable
opportunities for success}. GVSU's policy on face coverings is posted on
the
\href{https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/face-covering-policy-27.htm}{Lakers
Together web site}. Students who are not able to wear a face covering
due to a medical condition should
\href{https://www.gvsu.edu/dsr/}{contact Disability Support Services
(DSR)} to discuss their individual situation.

Please note, students who remove their masks during class, wear the mask
incorrectly (for example, with the nose exposed), or refuse to wear mask
at all will be reminded of this policy once, and then asked to leave if
non-compliance continues.

\textbf{Observe proper social distancing.} Your classroom has been
specially arranged so that students are 6 feet apart from each other and
from the professor at all times. This is sufficient for social
distancing and close enough so that 2-3 students can turn to each other
and discuss a concept. We will also leverage technology to allow for
more remote communication, for example using the chat rooms in
Campuswire. \textbf{Please do not encroach on the space of another
person or share physical objects with another such as pens, calculators,
or paper.}

\textbf{Practice appropriate personal hygiene.} Wash your hands
regularly or use hand sanitizer. If you must cough or sneeze, do so
facing away from other people and use the inside of your elbow to cover
your mouth, even if you have a mask on. You may wish to bring sanitizing
wipes to wipe down your desk and seat before and after class.

\hypertarget{contingency-plans-for-the-semester}{%
\subsubsection{Contingency plans for the
semester}\label{contingency-plans-for-the-semester}}

We will begin the semester in ``staggered hybrid'' mode, but several
things could happen during the semester that might alter this setup.
Here are the initial plans for the most likely of those things.

\textbf{If the entire university goes fully online:} In this case,
\textbf{all F2F meetings will be replaced by synchronous online
meetings}, still split into Red (MW) and Blue (TR) groupings. We will
also introduce \textbf{an option to participate in the course
asynchronously}, so that those with issues with sychronous online
participation can still participate in activities. No other changes will
be made.

\textbf{If the professor cannot be on campus due to self-quarantine, but
not because of illness:} (For example, if my kids or wife get sick or my
daily self-assessment directs me to stay at home) In this case, we will
follow the plan above for if the university goes fully online:
\textbf{F2F meetings will be replace by synchronous online meetings, and
an asynchronous option will be introduced}.

\textbf{If the professor cannot be on campus due to having a Covid-19
infection:} In this case, \textbf{the entire course will be moved to an
asynchronous online format} until I am well enough to resume teaching. A
proxy/substitute may be appointed to grade and give feedback on Daily
Prep and Followup Activities; all other graded work will be suspended
until I am well enough to grade.

In the latter two eventualities, you can expect a slowdown in the
grading process and significant changes to the course calendar or
syllabus. Please monitor your course announcements on a twice-daily
basis to ensure you have correct information.

\emph{Please note}: These plans may be changed overridden by
university-wide directives as the semester unfolds. Again, check course
announcements twice daily.

\hypertarget{encouragement}{%
\subsubsection{Encouragement}\label{encouragement}}

Although these plans can be scary and demoralizing, I want you to know
that \textbf{GVSU is doing everything in its power to keep people safe
from Covid-19}. In my view, GVSU's campus is at least as safe from
Covid-19 as the average large supermarket, which many of us visit on a
regular basis now without much trepidation. Furthermore I believe that
\textbf{if we observe reasonable precautions like the ones described
here, then while the risk of Covid-19 is still present, there's no
reason to be afraid.} We will still learn and grow intellectually just
as in ``normal'' times if we stay focused and work together.
