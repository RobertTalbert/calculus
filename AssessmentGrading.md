# Assessment and grading system in MTH 201

_This is an initial draft of syllabus language for the assessment and grading systems for MTH 201, Calculus, Grand Valley state University, Fall 2020._ 

## About your grade in MTH 201

Throughout the course, as you learn about Calculus, you'll be completing work that gives you the chance to show how well you understand what you are learning. Some of that work will be *assessed*, which means I will be reviewing what you submit and giving you feedback on your efforts. Your grade in the course will be based on the *quantity* of the work you do as well as the *quality* of that work. 

MTH 201 uses a *mastery grading* system for both individual pieces of work as well as for your course grade. In mastery grading, **we typically do not use points**; instead, the work you do is aimed at demonstrating mastery of various key learning targets, at or above a certain level of quality. If your work meets the quality standards, both for the answer and for the explanation of your reasoning, then you will be given full credit; otherwise you will be given helpful feedback and an opporunity to redo the work and meet the standard. 


## Types of work you will undertake 

+ **Guided Practice**: Before almost all designated class meetings, you will be asked to complete work aimed at preparing you for active work on the concepts of that class meeting through assignments called *Guided Practice*. These consist of video, text, and other resources for learning along with some exercises to *guide* you through *practicing* the ideas you need to learn.
