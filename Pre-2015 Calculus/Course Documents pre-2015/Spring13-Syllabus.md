## Course Information and Policies

### Catalog Description
A development of the fundamental concepts of calculus using graphical, numerical, and analytic methods with algebraic and trigonometric functions of a single variable. Limits and continuity, derivatives, indefinite integrals, definite integrals, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus; applications of derivatives and integrals. Please see the mathematics program for placement test details. Fulfills Mathematical Sciences Foundation.

### Textbook
Our textbook is *Active Calculus* by Matt Boelkins. This book is available as a **free PDF download** at [http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/Download.html](http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/Download.html). We will be working through all of chapters 1–4 and parts of chapter 5. You do not need a printed copy of the textbook, but if you would like a printed and bound copy of the book, limited numbers of printed copies are available in the GVSU bookstore, or you can print it yourself using either your own printer or a print/copy store. 

Throughout the course, **you will be expected to read the textbook for comprehension**, using the textbook and occasional extra materials to get a basic grasp on routine concepts and calculations before coming to class. In class, we will not cover everything you need to know in the course, but rather we will focus on gaining a deep understanding of the essential ideas of calculus and problem-solving so that you can then apply them to new problems. Part of your grade will consist of activities designed to help you with this acquisition of basic concepts. **You can ask questions at any time** about what you are reading through in-class questions, office hours, or posting to the course discussion board on Piazza. 

### Course overview 
The primary objective of this course is to help you become an independent, confident, skilled problem solver, especially in those problems that require the techniques and concepts of calculus. MTH 201 is a required course for all other courses in Mathematics and many other courses outside mathematics in the science, technology, and engineering fields as well as such areas as finance, economics, and statistics (and hence many of the social sciences). Additionally, Calculus is considered one of the great intellectual achievements in human history, and an understanding of calculus is an important part of a well-balanced liberal education. Finally, mastery of calculus requires mastery of certain habits of mind that come with being a skilled problem-solver, even in problems not involving calculus. 

**Calculus is a way of looking at the world and framing quantitative problems in terms of change, rather than amounts.** In particular, calculus focuses on the concept of a function and asks some combination of the following three questions: 

1. *What is the behavior of a function infinitely close to, but not directly at, a given point?* The concept that addresses this question is the **limit** of a function. 
2. *Given a specific input into a function, at what rate is the function changing at that point?* The concept that addresses this question is the **derivative** of a function. 
3. *Given the rate at which a function has been changing over a time interval, how much change accumulated over that time interval?* The concept that addresses this question is the **definite integral** of a function. 

We will study these concepts and their applications to real-world problems in depth in MTH 201, culminating with the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** which unifies all three concepts as the final item of the course. 

### Learning goals and expectations

Upon successful completion of the course, the student will be able to:

1. Demonstrate an understanding of the concepts of limit, derivative and integral in writing, and graphically.
2. Calculate, or approximate as appropriate, the limit of a function using appropriate techniques.
3. Find the derivative of elementary polynomial, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions.
4. Use rules of differentiation including the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, and implicit differentiation to compute the derivative of a function. Obtain expressions for higher order derivatives of a function.
5. Interpret the derivative as the instantaneous rate of change and as the slope of the tangent line.
6. Apply the derivative to find the line tangent to a function at a point and the linearization of a function at a point.
7. Apply the derivative to analyze graphical behavior of a function, motion problems, other rate problems, and optimization problems.
8. Construct a definite integral as the limit of a Riemann sum and use the sum to approximate a definite integral.
9. Apply the definite integral to analyze the area under a curve and motion problems.
10. State and apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
11. Use a variety of computing technologies effectively to identify patterns, make deductions, visualize information, solve problems and communicate results of one’s work. 
12. Exhibit the ability to acquire basic knowledge of a new concept on one’s own through reading and other media. 
13. Exhibit the ability to map basic concepts in calculus onto newer (harder) problems. 

Students in MTH 201 are expected to attend class regularly, work hard and with a positive attitude, be open to new ideas and new ways of doing things (especially math), and to have a good time doing it. 

From me, you can expect the following: 

- Careful design of learning experiences that engage your attention and help you learn. 
- Diligence in working with you both in class and outside of class. 
- Accessibility through a variety of channels, both electronic and face-to-face. 
- Respectful attention to your questions and difficulties and meaningful responses to your questions that are aimed at helping you become a better, more independent learner.
- Flexibility to adjust the pace and content of the course, within reason, in response to student interests and performance. 
- Timely return of graded work. 
- A positive attitude, sincere personal interest in your well-being, and a commitment to having fun in the course while we learn. 


### Assessment and grading

To gauge your progress toward the learning goals above, you’ll be assessed in several different, complementary ways: 

* **Preparation**. You will be asked to read through sections of the textbook that we will cover, prior to the class meeting in which we cover it, and complete the Preview Activities in the book as well as submit questions to answer. Preview Activities will be graded on a 2-point scale on the basis of completeness and effort. 
**Homework**. Nearly all class meetings will be followed up with a homework set that is to be done online using the WeBWorK homework system. This system poses problems, using random number generators to make sure each student has a different specific problem within the same basic type, and then you work the problem out on paper and submit your answer online. If you get a question wrong, you can re-attempt it as many times as you want prior to the deadline. We will discuss the basics of WeBWorK during our first lab session — it can be picky at times and it takes some getting used to. 
* **Weekly Skills Assessment**. Every Thursday during the final half-hour of the class, you’ll be given a written skills test that covers basic computational and conceptual knowledge from the course. These will be done individually and involve a combination of hand-calculations along with multiple choice and other questions. 
* **Class Activities**.  Most class meetings will consist not of lectures but of question/answer sessions and group activities. Some of these activities will come from the textbook; some activities will involve the use of audience response systems (“clickers”) to discuss conceptual questions. The second hour of class on Mondays and Wednesdays is set aside for computer lab activities. These will involve problems that ask you to use computing technology to identify patterns, make deductions about general mathematical properties, visualize information, and solve problems. 
* **Portfolio Problems**. Throughout your textbook are Exercises that take the basic concepts of calculus and go into considerably more depth than the basic examples in the book. You’ll be choosing some of these exercises from a list and writing them up for submission. Complete specifications for Portfolio Problems are given on the Portfolio Problems page. 
* **Final Exam**. The final exam for our class will occur during the week of June 17–19 (date and time TBA). This will be a comprehensive final exam taken during a two-hour period. 

### Attendance policy
The accelerated pace of the Spring term makes regular attendance critical. I will be recording attendance every day, and if you are not present, then you will not be able to participate in any work that contributes to your Activity grade. You will not be allowed to make up any class activity that you miss unless you clear the absence with me first and agree to make up the work on a timetable of my choosing. I reserve the right to say “no” to a request for a makeup if  the reason for an absence is insufficient. Absences due to oversleeping, recreational travel, or feeling ill without seeing a medical professional to verify an illness are automatically insufficient reasons to miss class. (If you had a vacation planned prior to the course starting, please see me. Otherwise do not plan vacation travel during the course.) 

Even if you are in attendance in a class, I reserve the right to lower the Activity grade of any student who is not actively participating. For example, students who sleep, text, or use social media inappropriately during class or who willfully withdraw from a group activity will not earn full credit on class activities. 

### Basis for Evaluation

Your grade for the course will be determined by the items of work described above using the following weights: 

<tr>
<td>Item</td><td>Weight</td></tr>
<tr><td>Preparation</td><td> 5% </td></tr>
<tr><td>Homework</td><td>5%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Activities</td><td>15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Weekly Skills Assessment</td><td>Minimum 15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Portfolio Problems</td><td>Minimum 15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final Exam</td><td>Minimum 30%</td></tr>

Notice that the above percentages add up to only 85%. The allocation of the remaining 15% is to be done by each student individually. You may choose to split up the 15% and add it onto the work categories however you choose, as long as: (1) you use all 15%, so that the percentages all add up to 100%; (2) you add the extra 15% only onto the final three categories (Weekly Skills Assessment, Portfolio Problems, Final Exam); and (3) you add no more than 10% into each category. For example, you may choose to add 5% to each of those final three categories; or 8% onto Weekly Skills Assessment, 2% onto the Portfolio, and 5% onto the Final. You’ll be asked to choose a list of percentages around the middle of the semester, and you’ll be allowed to change your choice in the last week of classes. 

Your semester grade will be calculated using the percentages you choose and applying a letter grade using the standard grade cutoffs: 93-100% A, 90-92% A-, 87-89% B+, 83-87% B, 80-82% B-, 77-79% C+, 73-76% C, 70-72% C-, 67-69% D+, 60-66% D, and 0-59% F. 

## Additional Information

### Technology
In addition to the textbook, you’ll be asked to use several items of technology in the class on a regular basis: 

- You’ll be expected to check your **email** multiple times each day for course announcements and communication.
- The course web site ([http://mth201.proftalbert.com](http://mth201.proftalbert.com)) will contain announcements, a page with links to documents and activities for each day of class, a link to a class calendar, and links to all of the other technologies used in the course.  
- Daily homework will be done using an online homework system called **WeBWorK**. This system automatically checks your homework answers and provides immediate feedback on your work.
- Lab activities will use a combination of three pieces of software: [Geogebra](http://www.geogebra.org) (a free software package that focuses on geometry but also has calculus capabilities), [Wolfram|Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com) (a free online computational knowledge engine), and a spreadsheet program. We will default to using Microsoft Excel for any spreadsheet work we do, but free alternatives to Excel are available such as [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org) and [Google Docs](http://drive.google.com). 
- We will use [Blackboard](http://mybb.gvsu.edu) for the online gradebook (but nothing else). 
- Portfolio problems require a formal, typeset writeup. This involves the use of a word processor or typesetting language capable of rendering mathematical notation. Options for doing this will be discussed in class. 

We will spend some class time getting set up on all of these technologies early in the course, and the [course website](http://mth201.proftalbert.com) will have links that take you to all these places, so you do not have to keep all the various web locations separate. You are welcome to ask questions and get help on technology at any time. 

**Regarding calculators**: MTH 201 does not require any specific model of calculator. However, we do require that each student own, and bring to class each day, some kind of portable device that is capable of doing scientific math and producing graphs of single-variable functions. Graphing calculators are OK, but you are encouraged to bring your portable devices (such as an iPod touch, smart phone, tablet device, or laptop) and use that device with apps or software that can perform these functions. For example, you can use an iPad running the Wolfram|Alpha app instead of a graphing calculator. 

### Technology restrictions
Generally speaking we will use technology liberally in the course. But it’s also important to develop fluency in calculus without technological support. So on Weekly Skills Assessments, you will only be allowed to use a basic four-function calculator. In particular, graphing calculators will not be allowed on Weekly Skills Assessments, nor will any technology use that goes beyond basic four-function arithmetic. 

Also, on most other work you turn in, the grade on your work will be based on the quality and clarity of your thought processes, not so much on whether your answer is right or wrong. So it will always be assumed, even if not explicitly stated, that all work done for credit must include a clear and correct explanation for how you got your answer. 

### Getting help in MTH 201
It’s important to know that you can ask questions in this course at any time through a variety of channels. Office hours are a good place to get personalized help. You are also encouraged to work with others when collaboration is allowed (see “Collaboration and academic honesty”). You can also get free help from the Math Center, which is located in MAK A-2-601 and is open during the the entire Spring term Monday through Thursday from 11:00am to 4:00pm. 

###Collaboration and academic honesty
Academically honest work by a student is work that authentically reflects the student’s understandings, however incomplete, of the work being done. **All the major aspects of the work handed in have been done by the student, without collaboration with others** (unless otherwise authorized). It is your responsibility to make sure that your work does not go past this limitation on work with others. 

In particular, no collaboration at all is allowed on Weekly Skills Assessments, Portfolio Problems, or the Final Exam. The only kind of help you may seek out on Portfolio problems is ungraded feedback from the professor through preliminary drafts; see the Portfolio Problems page for details. 

###Late submissions of work
Deadlines on graded items will be enforced fairly. Late submissions of work will not be accepted unless you have received prior approval. 

###Class etiquette
Students are expected to treat each other with respect. Students are also expected to promote a healthy learning environment, as well as minimize distracting behaviors. Moreover, every attempt should be made to arrive to class on time. If you must arrive late or leave early, please do not disrupt class.

Please turn off the ringer on your cell phone. I do not have a strict policy on the use of laptops, tablets, and cell phones. You are expected to be paying attention and engaging in class discussions. If your cell phone, etc. is interfering with your ability (or that of another student) to do this, then put it away, or I will ask you to put it away.

###Important dates

- **May 10:** 100% tuition refund deadline
- **May 17**: 75% tuition refund deadline
- **May 27**: Memorial Day recess (no class) 
- **June 7**: Deadline to drop with a grade of “W”

Also please note that I (Prof. Talbert) will be out of town during the entire week of June 3–7 to conduct a workshop at Ferrum College in Virginia. In my absence, Professor Paul Fishback and Matt Boelkins will be taking over the class that week. I will remain in contact for consultation and submission of work during that time. 

###Changes to the syllabus
This syllabus is subject to amendments and additions if circumstances warrant. All changes will be communicated appropriately to the class.
