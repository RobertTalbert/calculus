# Guided Practice for 1.1: How do we measure velocity? 

## Overview 
Our study of calculus begins with a basic building block for understanding change: the concept of **average velocity**. Two formulas for average velocity are introduced in the section and connected to the concept of the slope of a line. The concept of **instantaneous velocity** -- central to an understanding of calculus -- is introduced at the end. 

## Learning objectives 

### BASIC learning objectives
Each student will be responsible for learning and demonstrating proficiency in the following objectives PRIOR to the class meeting. The entrance quiz for the class meeting will cover these objectives. 

* Given a formula for the position of an object as a function of time, find the object's position at a specific time. 
* Calculate the average velocity of an object over a given time interval using the formula on page 2. 
* Calculate the average velocity of an object over a given time interval using the formula on page 4.
* Explain the differences between the two average velocity formulas in this section. 
* Explain the difference between average velocity and instantaneous velocity. 

### ADVANCED learning objectives 
The following objectives should be mastered by each student DURING and FOLLOWING the class session through active work and practice: 

* Use the second average velocity formula to find the average velocity of an object on an interval starting at time t = a and ending at time t = a + h, where a is given but h is a variable. Express the answer in simplest form as a function of h. 
* Given the average velocity of an object from time t = a to time t = a+h, find its instantaneous velocity at the single moment t = a. (See Example 1.1 and Screencast 1.1.3.)

## Resources
*Reading*: **Read Section 1.1, pages 1--7 in Active Calculus**. We will work the Activities in class, but you may also work on them outside of class for further understanding. 

*Viewing*: Watch the following videos at the MTH 201 YouTube Playlist. These have a total running time of 32 minutes, 49 seconds (i.e. roughly the same time as an in-class lecture on the material):

## Exercises 
These exercises can be done during or after your reading and video watching. They are intended to help you make examples of the concepts you are reading and viewing. Work these out on scratch paper, and then you will be asked to submit the results on a web form at the end. 

**Guided Practice exercises are graded on the basis of completeness and effort only.** So you should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put "I don't know", or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. 

1. Work through Preview Activity 1.1 in the section and use Geogebra to make the graph in part (a). You'll enter your responses to parts (b) and (c) on a web form given below. 
2. Suppose that an object is moving in a straight line, and its position *s* from the starting point at time *t* seconds is given by s(t) = 10 - âˆšt. Find the object's average velocity from t = 1 to t = 4 and state the units of measurements of the answer. Use the **first** average velocity formula, given on page 2 of the text. 
3. Redo exercise 2 except use the **second** average velocity formula, given on page 4 of the text. (Hint: What is the value of "h" here?)
4. Give a brief explanation of how we would find the instantaneous velocity of the object in exercises 2 and 3 by using the second average velocity formula. Be specific in your response (but not lengthy).
