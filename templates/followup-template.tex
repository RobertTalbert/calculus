        \item Post-class activities are to be worked out in ClassKick.
        \item There is nothing to turn in --- your work is saved automatically on ClassKick. 
        \item They are graded check/x on the basis of completeness and effort. 
        \item You can work freely with others on these, but please for your own benefit, don't just copy work. 
        \item If you need help or want Prof. Talbert to check your work, use the "raise hand" feature on ClassKick.
