## Exercises

## Submission, grading, and getting help 

**Submitting your work:** 

**How this is graded:** Guided Practice assignments are graded either **P** (Pass) or **NP** (Does not Pass). You will receive a **P** if your work: (1) is submitted by the deadline, and (2) each required exercise has a response that reflects a good-faith effort to attain a correct answer. *Mathematical correctness is not required for a grade of P, only completeness, effort, and meeting the deadline.* However, your work will receive an **NP** if your work is late, *or* if a required item is left blank (even accidentally), *or* if a required item does not show a good-faith effort to be right --- including responses of "I don't know", "I didn't understand", and so on. If you are stuck on an item, you're expected to ask questions and give your best effort. 

**Getting help on this assignment:** *You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others' answers.* Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #guidedpractice channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.
