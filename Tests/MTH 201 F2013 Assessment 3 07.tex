\textbf{Instructions}:  You may use a $3 \times 5$ notecard with notes on it as well as a calculator. Except on multiple choice questions, you need to show all work in a clear and complete way to receive credit. The Assessment will end promptly at 12:50pm unless you have made alternate arrangements.

\uplevel{\emph{The next several items are problems to solve. Be sure to give complete, clear, and correct solutions to each, not just answers unless clearly specified.}}


\question[20] For some function $f(x)$, whose formula you do not have, it is known that 
\[ f'(x) = -xe^{-x} (x-2) \qquad \text{and} \qquad f''(x) = e^{-x}(x^2 - 4x + 2) \]
Construct well-labeled first and second derivative sign charts for $f(x)$, clearly labeling all critical points, relative extremes, and points of inflection, as well as the relevant behavior of $f$ in each appropriate interval. Use your work to construct a well-labeled possible graph of $f(x)$ on the axes provided, using the additional given fact that $f(0) = âˆ’2$.

%\question[12] Family of functions

\question Suppose you want to make a fenced-in region like the one below: 
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=2in]{a3-opt}
\end{center}
	\begin{parts}
		\part[4] What is the total length of the fence (including the fence on the inside) in terms of $x$ and $y$? 
		
		\vspace{1in}
		
		\part[4] What is the area of the fenced-in region in terms of $x$ and $y$? 
		
		\vspace{1in}
		
		
		\part[12] If you have to make the area of the fenced-in region 24 square feet, how should you build the fence in order to minimize the amount of fencing used? Make sure you justify that your answer actually produces a minimum.

\question[20] Work EXACTLY ONE of the following problems. Clearly indicate which one you are doing and which one you are not doing; submitting significant work on both will result in a grade of ``0'' on this problem. Show all work and organize your solution clearly, as a narrative that explains the correctness to the reader using mathematics as support. You will lose credit for disorganized solutions. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If two resistors with resistances \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) are connected in parallel, as in the figure, then the total resistance \(R\), measured in Ohms \((\Omega)\), is given by:
		\[\displaystyle\frac{1}{R} =\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\] \leavevmode\\\relax 
		If \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) are increasing at rates of \(.3\,\Omega/s\) and \(.2\, \Omega/s\), respectively, how fast is \(R\) increasing when \(R_1=80\,\Omega\) and \(R_2=100\,\Omega\)?
		\item At noon, ship A is \(150 km\) west of ship B. Ship A is sailing east at \(35 km/h\), and ship B is sailing north at \(25 km/h\). How fast is the distance between the ships changing at 4:00 P.M.?

		\part[6] Calculate the Riemann sum $M_3$. Why can't we calculate $M_6$ in this case?
