\question Bob walks into his kitchen and turns on the hot water to wash off a pan. The  temperature of the water ($T$, in degrees Fahrenheit) after $t$ seconds of the water running is given in the following table: 
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c}
	$t$ (seconds) & 0 & 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 & 10 \\ \hline
	$T$ (degrees F) & 60 & 79.8 & 93.0 & 101.9 & 107.9 & 111.9 
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{parts}
	\part[6] How fast is the temperature climbing after 8 seconds? Give the best estimate you can using only the data in the table; show all work and put correct units on the answer. 
	
	\vspace{2in}
	
	\part[8] Find the linearization of $T$ at $t = 8$, and use the linearization to predict the water's temperature after 15 seconds.
	
	\vspace{2in}
	 

	
	\part[8] A model for the temperature function is $T(t) = 120 - 60e^{-0.2t}$. Using derivative rules, find the exact value of the instantaneous rate of change in the temperature at $t=8$. (Note that you estimated this value in part (a), so both answers should be relatively close to each other in value.)

\question[16] Choose EXACTLY ONE of the following problems to solve, and then solve it by giving a complete, clear, and correct solution that is supported by mathematical calculations. You will lose credit for solutions that are unclear, messy, or consist ONLY of calculations with no explanatory text. Clearly indicate which problem you are doing by circling the bullet point next to it. Providing significant work on more than one problem will result in a grade of ``0'' on this problem. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A rectangular storage container with an open top is to have a
		volume of 10 \(m^3\). The length of its base is twice the
		width. Material for the base costs \$15 per \(m^2\). Material
		for the sides costs \$16 per \(m^2\). Find the dimensions of
		the container which will minimize cost and the minimum cost.
		\item A water filter is in the shape of an inverted right circular cone with a height of 8cm and radius 6 cm. If water drips out of the cone so that the water level inside the cone is dropping at a constant rate of 0.1cm per minute, find the rate in which the radius of the surface of the water is changing at the instant the height of the water level is 4cm.
