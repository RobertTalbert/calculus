\textbf{Instructions}:  You may use a $3 \times 5$ notecard with notes on it as well as a calculator. Except on multiple choice questions, you need to show all work in a clear and complete way to receive credit. The Assessment will end promptly at 2:50pm unless you have made alternate arrangements. 

\begin{questions}

\uplevel{\emph{Items 1---10 are multiple choice questions that address a variety of learning objectives. Please circle the ONE response you believe is most correct. You do not need to justify your answer.}}

	\begin{parts}
		\part The average rate of change of $f$ at $x = a$
		\part The slope of the tangent line to $f$ at $x=a$
		\part The height of the graph of $f$ at $x = a$

				\part The graph of $g$ is concave down at $x = 2$
				\part Just (a) and (b)
				\part None of the above
			\end{parts}
	
\question[2] For any function $y = g(x)$, if $g''(x) > 0$, it means that 
	\begin{parts}
		\part $g$ is positive

\question[2] Suppose a car is moving down a highway, and its position $s$ (in miles) from its starting point $t$ hours after it begins moving is given by a function $s(t)$. Suppose also that $s(2) = 80$ and $s'(2) = 75$. The best interpretation of these data is:

		\part None of the above

\question Suppose that the depth ($D$, given in feet) of water in a pond is a function of time $t$ (in months since January 2013). In particular, note that April 2013 corresponds to the time value $t = 4$, June 2013 is $t = 6$, and August 2013 is $t=8$. Suppose we also know the following data about the depth of the water in the pond: 
\[ D(4) = 8.2 \qquad D(6) = 7.3 \qquad D(8) = 5.8 \qquad D'(8) = -0.3 \qquad D''(8) = 1.2 \]
	\begin{parts}
		\part[6] Find the average rate of change in the depth of the water in the pond from April 2013 to August 2013. Show your work and put correct units on your answer. 
		
		\vspace{1.5in}
		
		\part[6] Use a central difference to approximate the value of the instantaneous rate of change in the depth of the water in the pond in June 2013. Show your work and put correct units on your answer.

		\part[6] Find the local linearization of $D$ when $t=8$, and then use the local linearization to predict the depth of water in the pond in November 2013.

\question[6] Your response to the last question on this Assessment is to be typed up in an email and submitted to me (talbertr@gvsu.edu) no later than 5pm on Saturday, September 21. In this question, I am just soliciting your honest feedback on how the course is going so far. Please include anything you feel would be helpful in improving the course moving forward. You won't be penalized if you don't like everything (or anything!) and I certainly value your constructive criticism. The questions to address are: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item What's been your favorite thing about the course so far? 
	\item What's one thing you would like to see changed (that can be changed) and how would you change it? 
	\item In particular, how has the ``flipped'' setup of the course (lectures done outside of class; class time spent on activity) worked for you so far? 
	\item Anything else you want to mention? 
\end{itemize}
