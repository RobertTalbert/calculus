# Workflow for staggered hybrid MTH 201

## Parameters 

- Two sections, MTWR @ 50 minutes each. 
- Course is broken into 12 modules, with A and B parts. Four class days per module/two days per part. 
- No synchronous exams or quizzes -- 100% of meeting times spent on active work or review. 

## Workflow 

- First split class into two: Red and Blue. 
- Each day spent on active learning tasks that are submitted for engagement credit 


| Day | Activity -- Red  | Activity -- Blue | 
| :--:| :---------------:| :---------------: | 
| Prior to day 1 | Guided Practice A | Guided Practice A | 
| Day 1 | F2F active work | Remote active work | 
| Day 2 | Remote active work | F2F active work | 
| Prior to day 3 | Guided Practice B | Guided Practice B | 
| Day 3 | F2F active work | Remote active work | 
| Day 4 | Remote active work | F2F active work | 
| After day 4 | WeBWorK | WeBWorK | 

- Remote version of active work: Basically identical to F2F active work with extra metacognition, requirement to collaborate on CampusWire
- Remote group can either tune into the live stream, or work asynchronously
- F2F students can opt out of F2F and work online if they want or need to 
- But not vice versa, because we need to maintain social distancing; students allowed to request switch to different color if days don't work for them; survey students before week 2 
- If we have to pivot online, just switch all F2F work to synchronous online and retain asynchronous option 
- Week 1: Random sorting of students and redo starting week 2


## Sample workflow for Module 7 

*Module 7: How do we compute derivatives of composites? (2.5, 2.6) -- 10/12-10/15*

- Part A: Section 2.5 (Chain Rule part 1)
  - Guided Practice: Breaking down fundamental structure, recognizing that composite is not multiplication; doing Chain Rule of very basic composites
  - Part A active work: Polling questions about fundamental structure; practice with computing with the chain rule on Jamboard -- submit something to get EC for the work 
  - Part B active work: More of part A but with more difficulty; graphs and tables -- submit something to get EC for the work 
- Part B: Section 2.6 (Chain Rule recap + logs and inverse trig)
  - GP: Recap of definition of log and inverse trig; preview activities 
  - Part A: Logarithms 
  - Part B: Inverse trig functions 






## Original Staggered Hybrid concept for MTH 201

- Class would ordinarily met MTWR.
- Instead we use cohorts and staggered F2F meetings:
  - Group 1 meets F2F MW; on TR students are to use the time for working on asynchronous activities
  - Group 2 meets F2F TR; on MW students are to use the time for working on asynchronous activities
- What stays the same for both groups
  - All meetings are live-streamed and recorded for later access; group 1 can sit in virtually on the meetings for group 2 and vice versa, even ask questions via the backchannel
  - All students will need to complete pre-class work prior to the start of the new module
  - Split the module into A and B parts; complete pre-work prior to each lesson  
  - All student work on WeBWorK and application problems
- Structure of a group meeting
  - Q&A for 15 minutes
  - Active work for 15 minutes
  - Assessment for 15 minutes <-- could be changed to use McNulty style testing
    - 15 minutes for learning target quizzes doesn't feel like a lot, but OTOH....
      - Students will have other options
      - Idea is "focus on one thing"
      - You get to do it 2x per week and maybe assessment days later
- Assessment thoughts
  - Mastery grading
    - Map CLO's to MLO's then collapse the MLO's to distinct learning targets that map to assessments
    - Students are allowed multiple ways to satisfy the learning targets
      - Through in-class quizzing
      - Through combination of test plus Zoom oral exam
      - Just an oral exam
      - Work on an application problem plus Zoom oral exam
      - Basically anything that satisfies a target that isn't in person needs an in person wrapper
  - Basic concept:
    - Basic skills + application + engagement
    - Basic skills assessed through learning targets
    - Applications assessed through application projects (maybe an oral presentation at the end?)
    - Engagement is a combination of...
      - Showing up for in person meetings
      - Meaningful interaction on CampusWire
      - Doing other stuff that isn't related to Calculus -- extra reading, etc.
      - This feels like the concept of "engagement credits".
