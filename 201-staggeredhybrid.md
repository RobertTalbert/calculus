# Workflow for staggered hybrid MTH 201

Meetings are MTWR 50 minutes each.

+ **First:** Divide students into two groups, *Blue Team* and *Red Team*. Blue meets in person MW, Red meets in person TR.
+ Course content is divided into modules, and each module subdivided into "A" and "B" parts. Think of each subdivision as a single section of _Active Calculus_ although it's not always exactly that.
+ Each module is given four days of class meetings (not necessatily MTWR; depends on recess and assessment schedules)
+ **Student workflow:**
  + Prior to day 1: Both teams complete pre-class assignment on module part A, which covers Remember and Understand levels of Bloom's taxonomy.
  + Day 1: Blue Team meets in person:
    + 10 minutes of Q&A on pre-class work
    + 30 minutes of active learning tasks on Evaluate, Apply, and Analyze levels of Bloom's Taxonomy
    + 10 minutes of wrap-up
  + Day 2: Red Team meets in person and repeats the structure of Blue Team on Day 1.
  + Prior to Day 3: Both teams complete pre-class assignment on module part B, which covers Remember and Understand levels of Bloom's taxonomy.
  + Day 3: Blue Team meets to work with part B, same basic structure.
  + Day 4: Red Team meets to work with part B, same basic structure.
  + Also each week:
    + By Sunday night: WeBWorK assignment over entire module
    + Other WeBWorK: 5-question WW set on Part A due by end of day 3; 5-question WW set on Part B due by end of day 5 (always include review)
    + Each meeting day: Record and upload work on active learning tasks to Blackboard for engagement credit (this can be done even if not physically present)
+ Other assessments:
  + Application problems/problem sets due with incentive deadlines, float outside class timeline
  + Mastery Grading setup: ??? TBD

# Original Staggered Hybrid concept for MTH 201

- Class would ordinarily met MTWR.
- Instead we use cohorts and staggered F2F meetings:
  - Group 1 meets F2F MW; on TR students are to use the time for working on asynchronous activities
  - Group 2 meets F2F TR; on MW students are to use the time for working on asynchronous activities
- What stays the same for both groups
  - All meetings are live-streamed and recorded for later access; group 1 can sit in virtually on the meetings for group 2 and vice versa, even ask questions via the backchannel
  - All students will need to complete pre-class work prior to the start of the new module
  - Split the module into A and B parts; complete pre-work prior to each lesson  
  - All student work on WeBWorK and application problems
- Structure of a group meeting
  - Q&A for 15 minutes
  - Active work for 15 minutes
  - Assessment for 15 minutes <-- could be changed to use McNulty style testing
    - 15 minutes for learning target quizzes doesn't feel like a lot, but OTOH....
      - Students will have other options
      - Idea is "focus on one thing"
      - You get to do it 2x per week and maybe assessment days later
- Assessment thoughts
  - Mastery grading
    - Map CLO's to MLO's then collapse the MLO's to distinct learning targets that map to assessments
    - Students are allowed multiple ways to satisfy the learning targets
      - Through in-class quizzing
      - Through combination of test plus Zoom oral exam
      - Just an oral exam
      - Work on an application problem plus Zoom oral exam
      - Basically anything that satisfies a target that isn't in person needs an in person wrapper
  - Basic concept:
    - Basic skills + application + engagement
    - Basic skills assessed through learning targets
    - Applications assessed through application projects (maybe an oral presentation at the end?)
    - Engagement is a combination of...
      - Showing up for in person meetings
      - Meaningful interaction on CampusWire
      - Doing other stuff that isn't related to Calculus -- extra reading, etc.
      - This feels like the concept of "engagement credits".
