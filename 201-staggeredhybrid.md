# Staggered Hybrid concept for MTH 201

- Class would ordinarily met MTWR. 
- Instead we use cohorts and staggered F2F meetings: 
  - Group 1 meets F2F MW; on TR students are to use the time for working on asynchronous activities
  - Group 2 meets F2F TR; on MW students are to use the time for working on asynchronous activities 
- What stays the same for both groups
  - All meetings are live-streamed and recorded for later access; group 1 can sit in virtually on the meetings for group 2 and vice versa, even ask questions via the backchannel
  - All students will need to complete pre-class work prior to the start of the new module
  - Split the module into A and B parts; complete pre-work prior to each lesson  
  - All student work on WeBWorK and application problems
- Structure of a group meeting 
  - Q&A for 15 minutes 
  - Active work for 15 minutes 
  - Assessment for 15 minutes <-- could be changed to use McNulty style testing 
    - 15 minutes for learning target quizzes doesn't feel like a lot, but OTOH....
      - Students will have other options
      - Idea is "focus on one thing"
      - You get to do it 2x per week and maybe assessment days later 
- Assessment thoughts 
  - Mastery grading
    - Map CLO's to MLO's then collapse the MLO's to distinct learning targets that map to assessments 
    - Students are allowed multiple ways to satisfy the learning targets 
      - Through in-class quizzing
      - Through combination of test plus Zoom oral exam
      - Just an oral exam
      - Work on an application problem plus Zoom oral exam
      - Basically anything that satisfies a target that isn't in person needs an in person wrapper
  - Basic concept: 
    - Basic skills + application + engagement 
    - Basic skills assessed through learning targets 
    - Applications assessed through application projects (maybe an oral presentation at the end?)
    - Engagement is a combination of...
      - Showing up for in person meetings
      - Meaningful interaction on CampusWire
      - Doing other stuff that isn't related to Calculus -- extra reading, etc.
      - This feels like the concept of "engagement credits".
