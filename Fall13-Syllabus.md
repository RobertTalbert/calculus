Limits and continuity, derivatives, indefinite integrals, definite integrals, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus; applications of derivatives and integrals. Please see the mathematics program for placement test details. Fulfills Mathematical Sciences Foundation.

### Textbook
Our textbook is *Active Calculus* by Matt Boelkins. This book is available as a **free PDF download** at [http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/Download.html](http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/Download.html). We will be working through all of chapters 1–4. You do not need a printed copy of the textbook, but if you would like a printed and bound copy of the book, limited numbers of printed copies are available in the GVSU bookstore, or you can print it yourself using either your own printer or a print/copy store. **Please do not print the textbook in a GVSU computer lab**, because repeated large print jobs in the computer lab creates unsustainable costs for the university. 

Throughout the course, **you will be expected to read the textbook for comprehension**, using the textbook and occasional extra materials to get a basic grasp on routine concepts and calculations before coming to class. In class, we will not cover everything you need to know in the course, but rather we will focus on gaining a deep understanding of the essential ideas of calculus and problem-solving so that you can then apply them to new problems. Part of your grade will consist of activities designed to help you with this acquisition of basic concepts. **You can ask questions at any time** about what you are reading through in-class questions, office hours, or posting to the course discussion board on Piazza. 

### Course overview 
**Calculus is a way of looking at the world and framing quantitative problems in terms of change, rather than amounts.** In particular, calculus focuses on the concept of a function and asks some combination of the following three questions: 

1. *What is the behavior of a function infinitely close to, but not directly at, a given point?* The concept that addresses this question is the **limit** of a function. 
2. *Given a specific input into a function, at what rate is the function changing at that point?* The concept that addresses this question is the **derivative** of a function. 
3. *Given the rate at which a function has been changing over a time interval, how much change accumulated over that time interval?* The concept that addresses this question is the **definite integral** of a function. 

We will study these concepts and their applications to real-world problems in depth in MTH 201, culminating with the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** which unifies all three concepts as the final item of the course. 

That's what calculus is, but MTH 201 is about more than just calculus. In MTH 201, which is the first university mathematics class many of you take, our goal is to **do mathematics in the style of a professional**. We will focus not only on math content but also on becoming  independent, confident, skilled problem solvers, especially in those problems that require the techniques and concepts of calculus. We will get lots of practice in learning how to learn and becoming responsible for one's own education. And we will focus on communicating our results and their meaning and significance as a professional would be called upon to do. 

This is a significant change from the way you may have experienced math in high school, and you will be challenged no matter what your background. But you will also be supported in many ways, and I personally am on your side and want you to be successful. 

### The ``flipped'' format of MTH 201

In almost every mathematics course at GVSU and especially in MTH 201, we operate on the principle that **you will learn best when you are actively working on a task rather than passively listening**. Both passive listening and active work have their places in the learning process, but since active work is generally harder and requires more assistance than passive listening, we will be spending the bulk of class time together working actively on problems, where you can work at your own pace and ask questions freely with unfettered access to the professor.

To make time and space for this amount of active work in class, most of the lectures for this class have been recorded to video and [placed in a playlist on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9bIjQJDwfGuXQHuS5Jkmum_CFILoCZX-). These lectures have the same content and are roughly the same length as lectures that would normally be given in class. Rather than doing extensive homework problem sets outside of class, your outside-of-class time will largely be spent watching the lectures (generally around 20 minutes worth of lecture for each 50 minutes of meeting time, so something like 1.5–2 hours a week) and answering structured study questions about what you are watching. Likewise, instead of listening to lectures in class, class time will be focused on discussing your questions and working on problems that will challenge you to apply the basic material to new and interesting situations. 

This approach to doing class is sometimes called the "flipped classroom" because we are flipping the traditional roles of in-class and out-of-class work, and there is a growing body of experiences and research that shows that this way of doing class helps you not only to learn the material better but also to learn *how to learn*. 

Please be assured that you are not being asked to “teach yourself calculus”. In fact, you will be receiving a much higher quantity and quality of professor help in this format that you would in a traditional format, because the professor is available in the same room as you exactly when you are encountering the hardest work. Also, multiple means of asking questions and getting help outside of class have been set up (see “Getting Help in MTH 201″ below) so that you are never really working on your own (except on timed tests, of course).

Although you will not be “teaching yourself calculus”, our class format does help you learn to become an independent learner who can acquire the basics of new material on her or his own. This is an essential skill for a university education — and for life! — and a highly desirable skill in the job market.

### Learning goals and expectations

Upon successful completion of the course, the student will be able to:

1. Demonstrate an understanding of the concepts of limit, derivative and integral in writing, and graphically.
2. Calculate, or approximate as appropriate, the limit of a function using appropriate techniques.
3. Find the derivative of elementary polynomial, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions.
4. Use rules of differentiation including the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, and implicit differentiation to compute the derivative of a function. Obtain expressions for higher order derivatives of a function.
5. Interpret the derivative as the instantaneous rate of change and as the slope of the tangent line.
6. Apply the derivative to find the line tangent to a function at a point and the linearization of a function at a point.
7. Apply the derivative to analyze graphical behavior of a function, motion problems, other rate problems, and optimization problems.
8. Construct a definite integral as the limit of a Riemann sum and use the sum to approximate a definite integral.
9. Apply the definite integral to analyze the area under a curve and motion problems.
10. State and apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
11. Use a variety of computing technologies effectively to identify patterns, make deductions, visualize information, solve problems and communicate results of one’s work. 
12. Exhibit the ability to acquire basic knowledge of a new concept on one’s own through reading and other media. 
13. Exhibit the ability to map basic concepts in calculus onto newer (harder) problems. 

Students in MTH 201 are expected to attend class regularly, work hard and with a positive attitude, be open to new ideas and new ways of doing things (especially math), and to have a good time doing it. 

From me, you can expect the following: 

- Careful design of learning experiences that engage your attention and help you learn. 
- Diligence in working with you both in class and outside of class. 
- Accessibility through a variety of channels, both electronic and face-to-face. 
- Respectful attention to your questions and difficulties and meaningful responses to your questions that are aimed at helping you become a better, more independent learner.
- Flexibility to adjust the pace and content of the course, within reason, in response to student interests and performance. 
- Timely return of graded work. 
- A positive attitude, sincere personal interest in your well-being, and a commitment to having fun in the course while we learn. 


### Assessment and grading

To gauge your progress toward the learning goals above, you’ll be assessed in several different, complementary ways: 

- **Guided Practice assignments**. As described above, you will be responsible for completing an introductory set of readings and videos to give you initial contact with new material. To help you make sense of the reading and viewing, whenever we start a new section, you will be given a structured assignment called Guided Practice that includes some brief exercises to work. These will be submitted electronically before class and graded on a scale of 0 to 2, on the basis of effort and completeness. 
- **Entrance quizzes**. To ensure that you are completing all the reading and viewing independently, we will begin most classes with a short quiz over the essential components of the Guided Practice. 
- **Online homework.** To develop your basic conceptual and mechanical skill in between class meetings, most meetings will be followed with a homework set that is to be done online using the WeBWorK homework system. This system poses problems, using random number generators to make sure each student has a different specific problem within the same basic type, and then you work the problem out on paper and submit your answer online. If you get a question wrong, you can re-attempt it as many times as you want prior to the deadline. We will discuss the basics of WeBWorK during our first lab session.
- **Labs**. A single class meeting each week is set aside specifically for computer lab work. Labs in MTH 201 will focus on using computer tools (which for us means a combination of Geogebra, Wolfram|Alpha, and spreadsheets) to work a variety of problems that extend basic ideas to new situations. Labs will be worked in groups of 2 or 3 and written up professionally. 
- **Portfolio Problems**. Throughout your textbook are Exercises that take the basic concepts of calculus and go into considerably more depth than the basic examples in the book. You’ll be choosing some of these exercises from a list and writing them up for submission. Complete specifications for Portfolio Problems are given on the Portfolio Problems page. 
- **Assessments**. Three times during the semester, we will take a 50-minute assessment in class to gauge how well you've mastered the concepts and computations from our reading, viewing, and class activities. 
- **Final Exam**. A two-hour comprehensive final will be given during final exam week. For your section's time and date, please see the [Calendar](http://teaching.proftalbert.com/mth201f13/calendar/). 


### Attendance and timeliness policy
Attendance in class each day is expected from each student unless it's totally impossible. If you miss class, you will not receive credit for the entrance quiz for that day. If there are any other assessments given or due on a day you miss, you will not receive credit for those, either. You will not be allowed to make up any class activity that you miss unless you (1) clear the absence with me first and (2) agree to make up the work on a timetable of my choosing. I reserve the right to say “no” to a request for a makeup if  the reason for an absence is insufficient. Absences due to oversleeping, recreational travel, or feeling ill without seeing a medical professional to verify an illness are automatically insufficient reasons to miss class. (If you had a vacation planned prior to the course starting, please see me. Otherwise do not plan vacation travel during the course.) 

Note that entrance quizzes are usually given in the first five minutes of class. If you are late, you may not have sufficient time to complete the quiz; without an adequate excuse for lateness, no makeup quiz will be given. 

"Attending" class means not only being physically present but also engaged and actively participating in a positive way. If a student is disruptive or willfully disengaged, I reserve the right to adjust his or her entrance quiz score downward and/or dismiss the student from class. 

### Basis for Evaluation

Your grade for the course will be determined by the items of work described above using the following weights: 

<tr>
<td>Item</td><td>Weight</td></tr>
<tr><td>Guided Practice</td><td> 2% </td></tr>
<tr><td>Entrance quizzes</td><td>2%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Online homework</td><td>6%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Labs</td><td>10%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Portfolio Problems</td><td>15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Assessments</td><td>45% (15% each)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final Exam</td><td>20%</td></tr>

Your semester grade will be calculated using the percentages you choose and applying a letter grade using the standard grade cutoffs: 93-100% A, 90-92% A-, 87-89% B+, 83-87% B, 80-82% B-, 77-79% C+, 73-76% C, 70-72% C-, 67-69% D+, 60-66% D, and 0-59% F. 

## Additional Information

### Technology
Please see the [Course Technology page](http://teaching.proftalbert.com/mth201f13/course-technology/) for details on the technology used in MTH 201. The short version of this is: 

- We use a lot of technology in MTH 201 because the professions and careers that require MTH 201 use a lot of technology, and we will try to use the same kinds of technology as professionals do, and in similar ways. 
- You do not need a graphing calculator for MTH 201 but it's OK if you have one. 
- You do need to have some kind of portable computing device that will do what a graphing calculator does. This could be a graphing calculator, a smartphone with a calculator app, a laptop running mathematical software, etc. You need to have such a device and bring it to class every day. 
- We have a few pieces of software that we use more than anything: [Geogebra](http://www.geogebra.org), [Wolfram|Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com), and spreadsheets. These are all free downloads or free websites. 
- There are a few other pieces of software that we will use for course management: [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com), [Piazza](http://www.piazza.com), and something you can use to write up work that involves mathematical notation. 
- Don't worry if this sounds overwhelming. You'll get training on all this, and all the links above are in the right sidebar of any page connected to the course website. 

There may be some restrictions on technology for the Assessments and the Final Exam. On any work that you do in MTH 201, the grade on your work will be based on the quality and clarity of your thought processes, not so much on whether your answer is right or wrong. So it will always be assumed, even if not explicitly stated, that all work done for credit must include a clear and correct mathematical explanation for how you got your answer even if you use technology to get the answer. 

### Getting help in MTH 201
It’s important to know that you can ask questions in this course at any time through a variety of channels. Those channels include:

* Office hours, and by extension, through email and video chat with the professor. 
* Our [online discussion board at Piazza](http://teaching.proftalbert.com/mth201f13/about/piazza.com/gvsu/fall2013/mth201/home) which is populated by students from both sections 03 and 07, as well as other sections and their professors.
* A Q&A session on the day’s reading and viewing, that will be the first 10 minutes of most class meetings.
* In-class questions while you are working on activities.
* The [Math Center](http://www.gvsu.edu/mathcenter/), which is located in MAK A–2–601 (just down the hallway from my office and our classrooms).

The important thing is that you ask the questions that you have.

###Collaboration and academic honesty
Academically honest work by a student is work that authentically reflects the student’s understandings, however incomplete, of the work being done. **All the major aspects of the work handed in have been done by the student, without collaboration with others** (unless otherwise authorized). It is your responsibility to make sure that your work does not go past this limitation on work with others. 

In particular, no collaboration at all is allowed on Assessments, Portfolio Problems, or the Final Exam. The only kind of help you may seek out on Portfolio problems is ungraded feedback from the professor through preliminary drafts; see the Portfolio Problems page for details. 

###Late submissions of work
Deadlines on graded items will be enforced fairly. Late submissions of work will not be accepted unless you have received prior approval. 

###Class etiquette
Students are expected to treat each other with respect. Students are also expected to promote a healthy learning environment, as well as minimize distracting behaviors. Moreover, every attempt should be made to arrive to class on time. If you must arrive late or leave early, please do not disrupt class.

Please turn off the ringer on your cell phone. I do not have a strict policy on the use of laptops, tablets, and cell phones. You are expected to be paying attention and engaging in class discussions. If your cell phone, etc. is interfering with your ability (or that of another student) to do this, then put it away, or I will ask you to put it away.

###Important dates

* August 30: 100% tuition drop deadline and last day to add, register or pay
* September 2--3: Labor Day recess
* September 20: 75% tuition deadline
* October 7: Midterm evaluation period begins
