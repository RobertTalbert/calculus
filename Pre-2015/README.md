Pre-2015 MTH 201 (Calculus) materials
-------------------------------------

There are two instances of courses represented in this folder: Spring 2014 and Fall 2014. What makes these different from the most current versions of the course is (1) Spring 2014 was not flipped, and (2) neither Spring nor Fall 2014 used specifications grading. The version(s) of MTH 201 from Spring/Summer 2015 and forward IMO represent the model of learning I intend to use for all subsequent offerings of the course: flipped learning design for learning activities, and specifications grading for assessment of those activities. 

The materials for these earlier versions of the course are organized as follows: 

+ Course Documents (syllabi, etc.) 
+ Formative assessments (Guided Practice, in-class activities, etc.) 
+ Summative assessments (Tests and Final Exams)
