# Functions Bootcamp

## What is it? 

It's a module that students complete self-paced, in which they learn/review the basics of function notation, multiple representation, working with function tools like Desmos, interval notation, etc. -- everything they need to know about functions before getting too far into calculus. 

This will consist of some special videos made just for the bootcamp, WeBWorK practice sets, Desmos activities, and culminating in a take-home assessment that covers it all. Maybe 10 questions on that assessment -- like the algebra competency exam from 124. Must get 8/10 correct in order to have mastery, and must be done by the first week -- after that it reverts to a timed assessment to be taken along with the learning target assessments. 

## Learning objectives 

**Group F: I can use functions and other pre-Calculus mathematics proficiently.** 

- F.1: I can read and use graphs, tables, and formulas to access relevant information within a problem. 
- F.2: I can use appropriate algebraic techniques and terminology, including function notation, to help me solve problems. 
- F.3: I can identify the fundamental algebraic structure of a function (product, composite, etc.). 


1. Determine whether a relationship between two quantities is a function or not. 
2. Identify the independent and dependent variables in a function. 
3. Evaluate a function using a formula and correct function notation. 
4. Evaluate a function using a graph and correct function notation. 
5. Evaluate a function using a table and correct function notation. 
6. Evaluate an expression involving function notation using sums, differences, products, and quotients. 
7. Evaluate a composite of two functions. 
8. Identify the fundamental algebraic structure of a function (product, composite, etc.)
9. Given a function in one representation, change its representation into one or more others. 
10. Express a portion of the number line in correct interval notation. 
11. Determine the domain and range of a function and express it in correct interval notation.
