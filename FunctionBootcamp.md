# Functions Bootcamp

## What is it? 

It's a module that students complete self-paced, in which they learn/review the basics of function notation, multiple representation, working with function tools like Desmos, interval notation, etc. -- everything they need to know about functions before getting too far into calculus. 

This will consist of some special videos made just for the bootcamp, WeBWorK practice sets, Desmos activities, and culminating in a take-home assessment that covers it all. Maybe 10 questions on that assessment -- like the algebra competency exam from 124. Must get 8/10 correct in order to have mastery, and must be done by the first week -- after that it reverts to a timed assessment to be taken along with the learning target assessments.

## Detailed outlines

### Video 1: Relationships and functions 

Objectives: 

1. Determine whether a relationship between two quantities is a function or not. 
2. Identify the independent and dependent variables in a function. 


+ Almost every situation in real life involves quantities
+ Many of those quantities are related, and change in tandem with each other 
  + Example: Going for a run
  + Quantities: Time elapsed, distance, heart rate, pace, elevation 
+ Special relationship: When a value of one quantity determines exactly one value of the other 
  + If you know the time elapsed, you can find out my heart rate
  + If you know my heart rate, you can't really know my time elapsed -- same heart rate at different times 
  + If you know the elevation, you can't know my distance traveled 
  + But if you know the distance traveled, you can find out my elevation 
+ Functions: 
  + **A function is a process that may be applied to a collection of input values to produce a corresponding collection of output values in such a way that the process produces one and only one output value for any single input value**.
  + Example: Heart rate is a function of time 
  + Example: Elevation is a function of distance traveled 
  + Nonexample: Distance is not a function of elevation; pace is not a function of heart rate 
  + Word about graphs and the vertical line test 
+ Given a function, it's a PROCESS with an input and output
  + Input = independent variable
  + Output = dependent variable 
  + Examples (from above)
+ Quiz: Working a job. Two related quantities: Number of hours on your shift, and amount of money you earn on the shift. Which is a function of which? 
  + Could go either way -- normally we think of earnings as a function of hours 


### Video 2: Representations of functions 

+ Recap
  + A function is a relationship between two quantities in which the value of one quantity determines one and only one value of the other 
  + A process that can be applied to a collection of input values 
  + Input to the process = Independent variable; Output of the process = Dependent variable
+ Representing functions: Four ways 
  + In words
  + As data
  + As a graph
  + As a formula
+ Example: Covid-19 cases in Michigan 
  + As words: Can describe the behavior and state certain values 
  + As data: In a table 
  + As graph: Think of the points in the table as points on an xy-axis. The independent variable goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent goes on the vertical. Then plot the points -- *scatter plot*. Connect the dots -- *regression*. 
  + As formula: An algebraic expression that tells exactly how to produce output from input. Hard to get sometimes -- most functions are data or graphs. But here's an approximation...
+ Two rules about representations
  + All models are wrong, but some are useful
  + Changing representations gives you information 

### Video 3: Evaluating functions with formulas 

+ To **evaluate** a function means to find the output value that results from a given input. ("e + valuate")
+ This looks like different things for different representations 
+ Formulas: Simply replace all instances of the input/independent variable with the input
+ Example: E(h) = 11h. 
  + How much do you earn if you work 3.75 hours? 
  + E(3.75) = 11(3.75)
+ Example: f(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2
  + What this means 
  + Evaluate f at t = 2: f(2) = 64 - 16(2-1)^2 
+ Bonus feature for formulas: We can evaluate not only at numbers but also at expressions. 
  + f(2a) 
  + f(3+h)
+ Quiz time: g(r) = r^2 + 2r. Evaluate g(3) and g(a+b). 


# Video 4: Evaluating functions with graphs

+ To **evaluate** a function means to find the output value that results from a given input. ("e + valuate")
+ Graphs: Independent variable is on the horizontal or "x" axis, dependent variable on the vertical or "y" axis. 
+ To evaluate: Find the input on the horizontal axis, look up or down to find the graph, read over to get the output. 
+ Example with a basic function 
+ Example with a piecewise function 
+ Example where the output doesn't exist
+ Example where it's not a function 


# Video 5: Evaluating functions with graphs

+ To **evaluate** a function means to find the output value that results from a given input. ("e + valuate")
+ Tables: A row or column for the independent variable and one for the dependent
+ To evaluate: Find the value of the input and cross-reference the value of the output
+ Example of basic table
+ Example where the table value isn't given 

# Video 6: Evaluate an expression involving function notation using sums, differences, products, and quotients.

+ Sometimes we want to combine functions in basic ways using arithmetic. 
+ Example: Retirement portfolio with funds from two sources. (Give as table) 
+ General rule: Functions defined as sums, differences, products, and quotients -- just evaluate each function in the combination and do the arithmetic on the result
+ Example: Given f, g look at A = f + g, B = g - f, C = 4f*g, D = g/f^2. f is a formula, g is a graph. Find several values. 

# Video 7: Evaluate a composite of two functions.

+ Common way to combine functions is not to add, subtract, multiply, or divide but to evaluate them in sequence -- evaluate one function first and then use the output as the input for the second one. 
+ Example: Area of a ripple on a pond where the radius is a function of time 
+ Diagram the process
+ This is called COMPOSITION 
+ Notation using circles or just evaluation f(g(x))
+ THIS IS NOT MULTIPLICATION -- it's composition or "chaining". 
+ Example: Given f, g as formulas -- evaluate at 1-2 points and then get an expression; also reverse order 
+ Example: A is a table, B is a graph

# Video 8: Identify the fundamental algebraic structure of a function (product, composite, etc.)

+ Important to be able to describe the fundamental structure of a function -- what is it? 
+ Example: f(x) = x * 2^x Fundamentally it's a product. 
+ Example: g(x) = x + 2^x Fundamentally it's a sum. 
+ Example: h(x) = sqrt(x^2 + x + 1) Fundamentally it's a composite. 
+ Quiz: Choose sum, difference, product, quotient, composite. 
  + sqrt(x)/x+1
  + x*sqrt(x+1)
  + 1 + sqrt(x) 

# Video 9: Interval notation 

+ Often want to talk about sections of one of the axes, especially the x-axis 
+ Could do this with inequalities (examples) 
+ Simpler/shorter to use *interval notation*
+ Basic idea
  + Start point, stop point
  + A square bracket [ ] if the endpoint is included 
  + Parentheses ( ) otherwise 
+ Examples
  + [1,3]
  + (1,3) 
  + [1,3)
  + (1,3]
+ What if there's no endpoint? Use infinity symbol (never with square brackets)

# Video 10: Domain and range 

+ Domain = Set of all possible inputs
+ Range = Set of all possible outputs 
+ Example: f(x) = 2x - 1
+ Example: g(x) = x^2 - 1 
+ Example: Random graph 
+ Example: Table
