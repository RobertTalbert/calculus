# Functions Bootcamp

## What is it? 

It's a module that students complete self-paced, in which they learn/review the basics of function notation, multiple representation, working with function tools like Desmos, interval notation, etc. -- everything they need to know about functions before getting too far into calculus. 

This will consist of some special videos made just for the bootcamp, WeBWorK practice sets, Desmos activities, and culminating in a take-home assessment that covers it all. Maybe 10 questions on that assessment -- like the algebra competency exam from 124. Must get 8/10 correct in order to have mastery, and must be done by the first week -- after that it reverts to a timed assessment to be taken along with the learning target assessments. 

## Learning objectives 

**Group F: I can use functions and other pre-Calculus mathematics proficiently.** 

- F.1: I can read and use graphs, tables, and formulas to access relevant information within a problem. 
- F.2: I can use appropriate algebraic techniques and terminology, including function notation, to help me solve problems. 
- F.3: I can identify the fundamental algebraic structure of a function (product, composite, etc.). 


1. Determine whether a relationship between two quantities is a function or not. 
2. Identify the independent and dependent variables in a function. 
3. Evaluate a function using a formula and correct function notation. 
4. Evaluate a function using a graph and correct function notation. 
5. Evaluate a function using a table and correct function notation. 
6. Evaluate an expression involving function notation using sums, differences, products, and quotients. 
7. Evaluate a composite of two functions. 
8. Identify the fundamental algebraic structure of a function (product, composite, etc.)
9. Given a function in one representation, change its representation into one or more others. 
10. Express a portion of the number line in correct interval notation. 
11. Determine the domain and range of a function and express it in correct interval notation.

## Detailed outlines

### Video 1: Relationships and functions 

Objectives: 

1. Determine whether a relationship between two quantities is a function or not. 
2. Identify the independent and dependent variables in a function. 


+ Almost every situation in real life involves quantities
+ Many of those quantities are related, and change in tandem with each other 
  + Example: Going for a run
  + Quantities: Time elapsed, distance, heart rate, pace, elevation 
+ Special relationship: When a value of one quantity determines exactly one value of the other 
  + If you know the time elapsed, you can find out my heart rate
  + If you know my heart rate, you can't really know my time elapsed -- same heart rate at different times 
  + If you know the elevation, you can't know my distance traveled 
  + But if you know the distance traveled, you can find out my elevation 
+ Functions: 
  + A function is a process that may be applied to a collection of input values to produce a corresponding collection of output values in such a way that the process produces one and only one output value for any single input value.
  + Example: Heart rate is a function of time 
  + Example: Elevation is a function of distance traveled 
  + Nonexample: Distance is not a function of elevation; pace is not a function of heart rate 
  + Word about graphs and the vertical line test 
+ Given a function, it's a PROCESS with an input and output
  + Input = independent variable
  + Output = dependent variable 
  + Examples (from above)
+ Quiz: Working a job. Two related quantities: Number of hours on your shift, and amount of money you earn on the shift. Which is a function of which? 
  + Could go either way -- normally we think of earnings as a function of hours 


### Video 2: Representations of functions 

+ Recap
  + A function is a relationship between two quantities in which the value of one quantity determines one and only one value of the other 
  + A process that can be applied to a collection of input values 
  + Input to the process = Independent variable; Output of the process = Dependent variable
+ Representing functions: Four ways 
  + In words
  + As data
  + As a graph
  + As a formula
+ Example: Earnings and hourly work 
  + As words: "You earn $11 per hour" so working 3 hours -> $33. 
  + As data: Put it into a table 
  + As a graph: Think of the points in the table as points on an xy-axis. The independent variable goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent goes on the vertical. Then plot the points -- *scatter plot*. Connect the dots -- *regression*. 
  + As a formula: Represent the variables with letters. Hours = h, Earnings = E. Could say E = 11h. 
    + FUNCTION NOTATION: Often we write E(h) = 11h, "E of h" -- not multiplying but symbolizing that E depends on h
+ Three rules about representations
  + No one representation is always better than the others, and not all are equally useful. 
  + Changing representations gives information about the underlying idea. 
  + Be able to change any one representation of a function into any other. 
+ Tools for changing representations
  + Formula or Data to graph: Desmos 
  + Formula to data: Spreadsheet 
  + Data to formula: Also spreadsheet 


### Video 3: Evaluating functions with formulas 

+ To **evaluate** a function means to find the output value that results from a given input. ("e + valuate")
+ This looks like different things for different representations 
+ Formulas: Simply replace all instances of the input/independent variable with the input
+ Example: E(h) = 11h. 
  + How much do you earn if you work 3.75 hours? 
  + E(3.75) = 11(3.75)
+ Example: f(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2
  + What this means 
  + Evaluate f at t = 2: f(2) = 64 - 16(2-1)^2 
+ Bonus feature for formulas: We can evaluate not only at numbers but also at expressions. 
  + f(2a) 
  + f(1+h)
+ Quiz time: g(r) = r^2 + 2r. Evaluate g(3) and g(a+b).
