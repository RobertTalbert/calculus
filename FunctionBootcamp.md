# Functions Bootcamp

## What is it? 

It's a module that students complete self-paced, in which they learn/review the basics of function notation, multiple representation, working with function tools like Desmos, interval notation, etc. -- everything they need to know about functions before getting too far into calculus. 

This will consist of some special videos made just for the bootcamp, WeBWorK practice sets, Desmos activities, and culminating in a take-home assessment that covers it all. Maybe 10 questions on that assessment -- like the algebra competency exam from 124. Must get 8/10 correct in order to have mastery, and must be done by the first week -- after that it reverts to a timed assessment to be taken along with the learning target assessments. 

## Learning objectives 

+ Distinguish between a function and a relationship that is not a function. 
+ Express the output of a function corresponding to an input, or vice versa, using correct function notation 
+ Find the value of a function, or the input that produces a given output, using a graph, table, formula, or verbal description. 
+ Represent functions in four different ways (graph, table, formula, verbal) and given a function in one representation, switch it to any of the others. 
+ Express a range of variable values using correct interval notation. 
+ Determine the domain and range of a function.
