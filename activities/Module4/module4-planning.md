# Planning for Module 4

Coverage: 2.1-2.2

Micro objectives: 

-   Compute (without using limits) the derivatives of constant, power, and exponential functions.
-   Compute the derivative of constant multiples and sums of constant, power, and exponential functions.
-   Compute the derivative of the sine and cosine functions.
-   Use basic derivative rules to solve problems about slopes, velocities, and rates of change involving basic functions.

Main learning targets: 

- DC.1 **(CORE)**: I can compute derivatives correctly for power, polynomial, and exponential functions and the sine and cosine functions, and basic combinations of these (constant multiples, sums, differences).
