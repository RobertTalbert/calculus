<h2 id="daily-preparation-module-4a-elementary-derivative-rules">Daily Preparation, Module 4A: Elementary derivative rules</h2>
<p><strong>Due by:</strong> 11:59pm ET, Sunday, September 27</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time requirement:</strong> About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. <em>If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you’re not at least halfway done, DON’T work any further</em> — instead, <em>stop and ask for help</em> on the <code>#dailyprep</code> channel on CampusWire.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>All three modules leading up to this point have focused on what a <strong>derivative</strong> is: Its origins in average velocity and rate of change, what it tells us about the function we are differentiating, and the information contained between a function and its first two derivatives. In Module 4 we shift focus to <strong>computing derivatives</strong> by introducing some shortcut methods that will replace taking limits and using the definition. In Module 4A we begin this process by looking at shortcut methods for elementary functions: constant, power, and exponential functions along with basic combinations of these.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p><strong>Learning Targets addressed in this module:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DC.1 (CORE)</strong>: I can compute derivatives correctly for power, polynomial, and exponential functions and the sine and cosine functions, and basic combinations of these (constant multiples, sums, differences).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute (without using limits) the derivatives of constant, power, and exponential functions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DURING AND AFTER</strong> your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute the derivative of constant multiples and sums of constant, power, and exponential functions.</li>
<li>Use basic derivative rules to solve problems about slopes, velocities, and rates of change involving basic functions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Text:</strong> Read through <a href="%5Bhttps://activecalculus.org/single/sec-2-1-elem-rules.html%5D(https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-2-1-elem-rules.html)">Section 2.1</a> of the <em>Active Calculus</em> textbook. Work through the examples and all interactive exercises found at the end of the section.</p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> At the MTH 201 playlist on YouTube (<a href="http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus">http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus</a>), watch the following videos. The total running time is 23:06.</p>

<p>You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The exercises for this assignment are on Classkick. Go to <a href="http://app.classkick.com">http://app.classkick.com</a> and sign in with your username and password to access it. If you need the code, it is posted to Blackboard.</p>
<p>Your work is saved as you go, so there’s no “submit” step at the end.</p>
<h2 id="submission-grading-and-getting-help">Submission, grading, and getting help</h2>
<p><strong>Submitting your work:</strong> Just work through the activities; your work is saved as you go.</p>
<p><strong>How this is graded:</strong> Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of <em>completeness and effort</em>: If your submission has <strong>all parts completed</strong> (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and <strong>a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given</strong> (no responses of “I don’t know” or “I didn’t understand”) and <strong>the work is submitted on time</strong>, it gets a “check”. Otherwise it gets an “x”. If you are stuck on an item, you’re expected to ask questions and give your best effort.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help on this assignment:</strong> <em>You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others’ answers.</em> Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.</p>
