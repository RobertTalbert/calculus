# MTH 201: Calculus 

## Daily Preparation, Module 4A: Elementary derivative rules

**Due by:** 11:59pm ET, Sunday, September 27

**Estimated time requirement:** About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. *If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you're not at least halfway done, DON'T work any further* --- instead, *stop and ask for help* on the `#dailyprep` channel on CampusWire. 

## Overview 

All three modules leading up to this point have focused on what a **derivative** is: Its origins in average velocity and rate of change, what it tells us about the function we are differentiating, and the information contained between a function and its first two derivatives. In Module 4 we shift focus to **computing derivatives** by introducing some shortcut methods that will replace taking limits and using the definition. In Module 4A we begin this process by looking at shortcut methods for elementary functions: constant, power, and exponential functions along with basic combinations of these. 


## What you will learn 

**Learning Targets addressed in this module:** 

- **DC.1 (CORE)**: I can compute derivatives correctly for power, polynomial, and exponential functions and the sine and cosine functions, and basic combinations of these (constant multiples, sums, differences).

**BEFORE** your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following: 

-  Compute (without using limits) the derivatives of constant, power, and exponential functions.
-  Compute the derivative of constant multiples and sums of constant, power, and exponential functions.

**DURING AND AFTER** your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following: 

Use basic derivative rules to solve problems about slopes, velocities, and rates of change involving basic functions.


## Resources for Learning

**Text:** Read through [Section 1.6](https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-6-second-d.html) of the *Active Calculus* textbook. Work through the examples and all interactive exercises found at the end of the section. 

**Video:** At the MTH 201 playlist on YouTube (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus), watch the following videos. The total running time is 10:50.

- Screencast 1.6.1: Quick review: The second derivative (3:07) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtzyPEk2zxA
- Screencast 1.6.3: Determining concavity from a graph (7:43) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1_o4E-LGsA

**Bonus screencasts:** These are optional, but good: 

- Concavity, inflection points, and second derivative (Organic Chemistry Tutor) (12:49) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhqNbQi9QPk
- Concavity introduction (Khan Academy) (9:41) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcEqOzNov4E 
- Concavity, inflection points, and second derivative (PatrickJMT) (10:23) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1N8zyVhWxM 
- Not a screencast, but [a tutorial website at Khan Academy on concavity and the second derivative](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-diff-analytical-applications-new/ab-5-6b/a/concavity-review). 
- [Another tutorial website from Lamar University on concavity](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/shapeofgraphptii.aspx). Nice pictures. 
  
You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.


## Exercises

The exercises for this assignment are on Desmos this time.  **Be sure to only use the link below for your section** or your work will end up in the wrong place. 

- Section 02: https://student.desmos.com/join/5mekk5 
- Section 04: https://student.desmos.com/join/mkxb62 

Your work is saved as you go, so there's no "submit" step at the end. 

## Submission, grading, and getting help 

**Submitting your work:** Just work through the activities; your work is saved as you go. 

**How this is graded:** Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of *completeness and effort*: If your submission has **all parts completed** (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and **a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given** (no responses of "I don't know" or "I didn't understand") and **the work is submitted on time**, it gets a "check". Otherwise it gets an "x". If you are stuck on an item, you're expected to ask questions and give your best effort.  

**Getting help on this assignment:** *You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others' answers.* Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.
