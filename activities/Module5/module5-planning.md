# Module 5 planning

## Overall

- Covers Product and Quotient Rule -- 2.3 and 2.4
- 2.3 = Product and Quotient Rules
- 2.4 = More trig functions (applications) 
- Practice should include review questions -- and questions of what we don't know how to do yet 

Main LT's: 

-   DC.2  **(CORE)**: I can compute derivatives correctly for products, quotients, and composites of functions.
-   DC.3: I can compute derivatives correctly using multiple rules in combination.

Although we don't really round this off until Module 6 

## Parts

### A

Basic: 

-   State the Product Rule and Quotient Rule.
-   Use the Product Rule to differentiate products of basic functions.
-   Use the Quotient Rule to differentiate quotients of basic functions.

Advanced: 

-   Use derivative rules (including PR and QR) to solve problems about slopes, velocities, and rates of change involving basic functions.


Class Activities: 

- Polling: What rule would apply, or is there a rule that applies 
- Group practice with QR on just functions, also functions given as graphs and tables, and applications to the usual stuff. 
- 



### B

-   Compute the derivatives of the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions.

Also combinations of rules -- didn't get to this in part A
