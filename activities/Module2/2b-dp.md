# MTH 201: Calculus 

## Daily Preparation, Module 2B: The derivative of a function, as a function

**Due by:** 11:59pm ET, Tuesday September 15

**Estimated time requirement:** About 45 minutes for the whole assignment. *If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you're not at least halfway done, DON'T work any further* --- instead, *stop and ask for help* on the `#dailyprep` channel on CampusWire. 

## Overview 

In part A, we gave a formal definition of the **derivative** of a function at a point, that tells us information about the rate of change in the function at that point. But since the derivative value itself changes when you change the point, that makes the derivative itself a new function that's "derived" from the original. In part B, we'll modify the definition of the derivative to get a way of computing the derivative as a function, and think about how this works when the original function is given as a graph and not a formula. 


## What you will learn 

**Learning Targets addressed in this module:** 

- D.1 **(CORE)**: I can find the derivative of a function, both at a point and as a function, using thedefinition of the derivative. 
- D.2 **(CORE)**: I can use derivative notation correctly, state the units of a derivative, estimate the value of a derivative using difference quotients, and correctly interpret the meaning of aderivative in context. 

**BEFORE** your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following: 

- State the formal definition of the derivative of a function.


**DURING AND AFTER** your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Given the graph of a function, make a reasonable sketch of the graph of its derivative.
- Compute the formula for the derivative of a function by setting up and evaluating the limit in its definition.

## Resources for Learning

**Text:** Read through Section 1.4 of the *Active Calculus* textbook: https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-3-derivative-pt.html  Work through the examples and all interactive exercises found at the end of the section. 

**Video:** At the MTH 201 playlist on YouTube (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus), watch the following videos. The total running time is 14:30. 

- Screencast 1.4.1: Quick review -- The derivative function (2:39) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzrkq1r-sAI
- Screencast 1.4.2: Limit definition of derivative (5:37) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62mySLhhfaQ
- Screencast 1.4.3: Sketching a derivative graph (6:14) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSgyDembmXg
  
You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.


## Exercises

The exercises for this assignment are on Classkick this time. Go to [app.classkick.com](app.classkick.com) and use the code for your section below. **Be sure to only use the code for your section** or your work will end up in the wrong place.

Your work is saved as you go, so there's no "submit" step at the end. 

## Submission, grading, and getting help 

**Submitting your work:** Just work through the activities; your work is saved as you go. 

**How this is graded:** Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of *completeness and effort*: If your submission has **all parts completed** (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and **a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given** (no responses of "I don't know" or "I didn't understand") and **the work is submitted on time**, it gets a "check". Otherwise it gets an "x". If you are stuck on an item, you're expected to ask questions and give your best effort.  

**Getting help on this assignment:** *You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others' answers.* Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.
