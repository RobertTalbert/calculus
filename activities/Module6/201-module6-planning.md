# Module 6 planning

## Overall 

Focus is on the Chain Rule and remaining derivative rules. Learning Targets: 

-   DC.2  **(CORE)**: I can compute derivatives correctly for products, quotients, and composites of functions.
-   DC.3: I can compute derivatives correctly using multiple rules in combination.
-   DC.4: I can compute the derivatives correctly for logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse trigonometric functions.

Micro-objectives: 

+ State the Chain Rule.
+ Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a composite of two basic functions.
+ Differentiate a function whose derivative involves a mixture of rules (Product, Quotient, Chain, etc.)
+ Compute the derivative of the function $y = \ln(x)$.
+ Compute the derivatives of the arcsine and arctangent functions.
+ Given an invertible function, state a rule for the derivative of its inverse.  


## Part A: Section 2.5

Objectives: 

+ (Review) Determine the fundamental algebraic structure of a function. 
+ (Review) If the fundamental algebraic structure of a function is a *composite*, determine the inner and outer functions in the composite. 
+ State the Chain Rule.
+ Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a composite of two basic functions.
+ Differentiate a function whose derivative involves a mixture of rules (Product, Quotient, Chain, etc.)


**Plan:**

- In class: Lots of practice decomposing functions and finding derivatives with the Chain Rule; identifying which rules to use and in which order  
- Preclass: Review of composites, fundamental algebraic structure, using the Chain Rule in simple cases 
- Followup: Combinations of rules + applications 


## Part B: Section 2.6 (inverse functions)
