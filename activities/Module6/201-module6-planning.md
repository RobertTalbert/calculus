# Module 6 planning

## Overall 

Focus is on the Chain Rule and remaining derivative rules. Learning Targets: 

-   DC.2  **(CORE)**: I can compute derivatives correctly for products, quotients, and composites of functions.
-   DC.3: I can compute derivatives correctly using multiple rules in combination.
-   DC.4: I can compute the derivatives correctly for logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse trigonometric functions.

Micro-objectives: 

+ State the Chain Rule.
+ Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a composite of two basic functions.
+ Differentiate a function whose derivative involves a mixture of rules (Product, Quotient, Chain, etc.)
+ Compute the derivative of the function $y = \ln(x)$.
+ Compute the derivatives of the arcsine and arctangent functions.
+ Given an invertible function, state a rule for the derivative of its inverse.
