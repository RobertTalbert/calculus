# Module 12 

-   INT.4  **(CORE)**: I can evaluate a definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
-   INT.5: I can correctly antidifferentiate basic functions and identify antiderivatives.

**Module 11B:** Introduces FTC and ends with identifying basic antiderivatives

**Part A:** Practice with FTC computation and applications

**Part B:** Total change theorem 


## Part A

+ (*Review*) State the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
+ (*Review*) Find the most general antiderivative of a function.
+ (*Review*) Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find the exact value of a definite integral using an antiderivative.

---

+ Identify when basic antidifferentiation does *not* allow you to compute an integral. 
+ Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to solve problems about distance traveled, displacement, and total change. 


## Part B

+ State the Total Change Theorem. 
+ Explain how a definite integral can be used to solve a problem about total change. 

---

+ Find the total amount of change in a function on an interval, using a definite integral.
