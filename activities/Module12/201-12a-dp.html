<h2 id="daily-preparation-module-12a-applying-the-definite-integral">Daily Preparation, Module 12A: Applying the definite integral</h2>
<p><strong>Due by:</strong> 11:59pm ET, <strong>Sunday, November 29</strong> (Back to the original schedule)</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time requirement:</strong> About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. <em>If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you’re not at least halfway done, DON’T work any further</em> — instead, <em>stop and ask for help</em> on the <code>#dailyprep</code> channel on CampusWire.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We’ve made it to the final module of the course! In Module 12, we’ll continue to build on the concept of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Module 12A is mainly a review and extension of the ideas from Module 11B — the Fundamental Theorem itself, and how to compute definite integrals with it (and apply the concepts to real problems).</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p><strong>Learning Targets addressed in this module:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>INT.4</strong>  <strong>(CORE)</strong>: I can evaluate a definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.</li>
<li><strong>INT.5:</strong> I can correctly antidifferentiate basic functions and identify antiderivatives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>(<em>Review</em>) State the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.</li>
<li>(<em>Review</em>) Find the most general antiderivative of a function.</li>
<li>(<em>Review</em>) Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find the exact value of a definite integral using an antiderivative.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DURING AND AFTER</strong> your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify when basic antidifferentiation does <em>not</em> allow you to compute an integral.</li>
<li>Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to solve problems about distance traveled, displacement, and total change.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources-for-learning">Resources for Learning</h2>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> No video to watch this time. Re-watch any ones from Module 11B where you feel you might need extra review.</p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> Re-read <a href="https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-4-4-FTC.html">Section 4.4 in the Active Calculus text</a>.</p>
<p>You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>These are on Classkick. Go to <a href="http://app.classkick.com">app.classkick.com</a> and log in, and it should be in your list. If you need a code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Section 02: <code>GA8 DTM</code></li>
<li>Section 04: <code>2K2 2QM</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submission-grading-and-getting-help">Submission, grading, and getting help</h2>
<p><strong>Submitting your work:</strong> Just work through the activities; your work is saved as you go.</p>
<p><strong>How this is graded:</strong> Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of <em>completeness and effort</em>: If your submission has <strong>all parts completed</strong> (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and <strong>a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given</strong> (no responses of “I don’t know” or “I didn’t understand”) and <strong>the work is submitted on time</strong>, it gets a “check”. Otherwise it gets an “x”. If you are stuck on an item, you’re expected to ask questions and give your best effort.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help on this assignment:</strong> <em>You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others’ answers.</em> Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.</p>
