# MTH 201: Calculus 

## Daily Preparation, Module 3B: The second derivative and concavity

**Due by:** 11:59pm ET, Tuesday September 22

**Estimated time requirement:** About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. *If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you're not at least halfway done, DON'T work any further* --- instead, *stop and ask for help* on the `#dailyprep` channel on CampusWire. 

## Overview 

In Part B of Module 3 we introduce a powerful new tool for examining the rate of change in a function --- the **second derivative**. The second derivative is what you get when you find the derivative of a function, then find the derivative of *the result*. The second derivative gives information about a function's rate of change that is subtle but important --- namely, what we call the **concavity** of the function. Having information about a function, its derivative, and its second derivative gives us a complete "fingerprint" of how the function behaves. 


## What you will learn 

**Learning Targets addressed in this module:** 

- **D.2 (CORE)**: I can use derivative notation correctly, state the units of a derivative, estimate the value of a derivative using difference quotients, and correctly interpret the meaning of a derivative in context.
- **D.3 (CORE)**: Given information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$, I can correctly give information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$ and the increasing/decreasing behavior and concavity of $f$ (and vice versa).

**BEFORE** your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following: 

+ State the definition of the *second derivative* of a function.
+ Determine whether a function is increasing, decreasing, or constant on an interval by examining the sign of its derivative. (Conversely, state the sign of a function's derivative using information about whether the function is increasing, decreasing, or constant.)
+ Determine whether a function is concave up or concave down on an interval by examining its graph.

**DURING AND AFTER** your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following: 

+ Explain the connection between concavity of a function and its first and second derivatives.  
+ If a function is given with units for the input and output, state the units of the second derivative.
+ Given the graph of a function, make a reasonable sketch of the graph of its second derivative.


## Resources for Learning

**Text:** Read through [Section 1.6](https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-6-second-d.html) of the *Active Calculus* textbook. Work through the examples and all interactive exercises found at the end of the section. 

**Video:** At the MTH 201 playlist on YouTube (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus), watch the following videos. The total running time is 10:50.

- Screencast 1.6.1: Quick review: The second derivative (3:07) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtzyPEk2zxA
- Screencast 1.6.3: Determining concavity from a graph (7:43) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1_o4E-LGsA

**Bonus screencasts:** These are optional, but good: 

- Concavity, inflection points, and second derivative (Organic Chemistry Tutor) (12:49) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhqNbQi9QPk
- Concavity introduction (Khan Academy) (9:41) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcEqOzNov4E 
- Concavity, inflection points, and second derivative (PatrickJMT) (10:23) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1N8zyVhWxM 
- Not a screencast, but [a tutorial website at Khan Academy on concavity and the second derivative](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-diff-analytical-applications-new/ab-5-6b/a/concavity-review). 
- [Another tutorial website from Lamar University on concavity](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/shapeofgraphptii.aspx). Nice pictures. 
  
You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.


## Exercises

The exercises for this assignment are on Desmos this time.  **Be sure to only use the link below for your section** or your work will end up in the wrong place. 

- Section 02: https://student.desmos.com/join/5mekk5 
- Section 04: https://student.desmos.com/join/tcv5eg 

Your work is saved as you go, so there's no "submit" step at the end. 

## Submission, grading, and getting help 

**Submitting your work:** Just work through the activities; your work is saved as you go. 

**How this is graded:** Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of *completeness and effort*: If your submission has **all parts completed** (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and **a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given** (no responses of "I don't know" or "I didn't understand") and **the work is submitted on time**, it gets a "check". Otherwise it gets an "x". If you are stuck on an item, you're expected to ask questions and give your best effort.  

**Getting help on this assignment:** *You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others' answers.* Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.
