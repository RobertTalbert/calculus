# MTH 201: Calculus 

## Daily Preparation, Module 3B: The second derivative and concavity

**Due by:** 11:59pm ET, Sunday September 20

**Estimated time requirement:** About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. *If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you're not at least halfway done, DON'T work any further* --- instead, *stop and ask for help* on the `#dailyprep` channel on CampusWire. 

## Overview 

Being able to compute derivatives is nice, but what's more important is **being able to interpret the information that those calculations give you**. (Most of the computations we've seen and will see can be done by a computer --- but computers can't interpret meaning!) This module is a fairly compressed look at several important interpretive ideas that help us turn computations into information. In Part A, we'll look at how to estimate a derivative when you don't have much information about it, the information that the sign (positive/negative) of a derivative tells you about the derivative, and introduce the idea of the second derivative and concavity.

## What you will learn 

**Learning Targets addressed in this module:** 

- **D.2 (CORE)**: I can use derivative notation correctly, state the units of a derivative, estimate the value of a derivative using difference quotients, and correctly interpret the meaning of a derivative in context.
- **D.3 (CORE)**: Given information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$, I can correctly give information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$ and the increasing/decreasing behavior and concavity of $f$ (and vice versa).
- **D.4**: I can determine where a function is continuous or differentiable given a graph or formula of the function and explain my reasoning.

**BEFORE** your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following: 


+ Determine whether a function is increasing, decreasing, or constant on an interval by examining the sign of its derivative. (Conversely, state the sign of a function's derivative using information about whether the function is increasing, decreasing, or constant.)
+ State the definition of the second derivative of a function.
+ Explain the meaning of the terms _concave up_ and _concave down_ and explain the connection between concavity of a function and its first and second derivatives.  
+ Determine whether a function is concave up or concave down on an interval by examining its graph.
+ Given the graph of a function,  make a reasonable sketch of the graph of its second derivative.
+ If a function is given with units for the input and output, state the units of the second derivative.





**DURING AND AFTER** your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Determine whether a function is increasing, decreasing, or constant on an interval by examining the sign of its derivative. (Conversely, state the sign of a function's derivative using information about whether the function is increasing, decreasing, or constant.)
- Interpret the meaning of the derivative of a function that models a real-life situation, in terms instantaneous rates of change.

## Resources for Learning

**Text:** Read through [Section 1.5](https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-1-5-units.html) of the *Active Calculus* textbook. Work through the examples and all interactive exercises found at the end of the section. 

**Video:** At the MTH 201 playlist on YouTube (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus), watch the following videos. The total running time is 8:42. 

- Screencast 1.5.1: Quick review: Interpreting, estimating, and using the derivative (3:27) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZa0uNu6Uyk
- Screencast 1.5.2: Estimating the derivative (5:15) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWdijnTdkTk

**Bonus screencast for those who like spreadsheets:** Screencast 1.5.3: Estimating derivatives using spreadsheets (5:25) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ_OZ-Uxs3o&list=PL9bIjQJDwfGuXQHuS5Jkmum_CFILoCZX-&index=16 
  
You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.


## Exercises

The exercises for this assignment are on Desmos this time.  **Be sure to only use the link below for your section** or your work will end up in the wrong place. 

- Section 02: https://student.desmos.com/join/hun2ty
- Section 04: https://student.desmos.com/join/tcv5eg 

Your work is saved as you go, so there's no "submit" step at the end. 

## Submission, grading, and getting help 

**Submitting your work:** Just work through the activities; your work is saved as you go. 

**How this is graded:** Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of *completeness and effort*: If your submission has **all parts completed** (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and **a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given** (no responses of "I don't know" or "I didn't understand") and **the work is submitted on time**, it gets a "check". Otherwise it gets an "x". If you are stuck on an item, you're expected to ask questions and give your best effort.  

**Getting help on this assignment:** *You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others' answers.* Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.
