<h2 id="daily-preparation-module-8b-applying-the-extreme-value-theorem">Daily Preparation, Module 8B: Applying the Extreme Value Theorem</h2>
<p><strong>Due by:</strong> 11:59pm ET, <strong>SUNDAY</strong>, November 1 (Note the different date!)</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time requirement:</strong> About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. <em>If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you’re not at least halfway done, DON’T work any further</em> — instead, <em>stop and ask for help</em> on the <code>#dailyprep</code> channel on CampusWire.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Having learned about the Extreme Value Theorem and how to use it to find absolute extreme values of a continuous function on a closed interval, we’ll use Module 8B to put it to work on applied problems. This includes <em>building the model first</em> and then using the Extreme Value Theorem to find its absolute extrema.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p><strong>Learning Targets addressed in this module:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DA.3</strong>: I can use the Extreme Value Theorem to find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a closed interval.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>(<em>Review</em>) State the <strong>Extreme Value Theorem</strong> and explain the three-step process it provides for finding the absolute extreme values of a continuous function on a closed interval.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DURING AND AFTER</strong> your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given an applied setting, build a function that models the situation; identify a closed interval for its domain; then identify its absolute maximum and minimum values on the interval.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources-for-learning">Resources for Learning</h2>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> In the <em>Active Calculus</em> text, re-read part 3.3.2 “Moving Toward Applications” from <a href="https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-3-3-optimization.html">Section 3.3</a>. Especially, study Example 3.3.4 carefully and aim to understand each step of the process.</p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> No new videos this time, although you might benefit from a quick review of the videos for Module 8A.</p>
<p>You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>Here is an interactive demo for the problem found in Example 3.3.4 that will be the focal point of the exercises this time. If you can’t see it, go here: <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/geometry/bd8g76gu">https://www.geogebra.org/geometry/bd8g76gu</a></p>

<p>The exercises are on Classkick. If you need codes, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Section 02: <code>PVJ X8K</code></li>
<li>Section 04: <code>LRW WVD</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submission-grading-and-getting-help">Submission, grading, and getting help</h2>
<p><strong>Submitting your work:</strong> Just work through the activities; your work is saved as you go.</p>
<p><strong>How this is graded:</strong> Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of <em>completeness and effort</em>: If your submission has <strong>all parts completed</strong> (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and <strong>a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given</strong> (no responses of “I don’t know” or “I didn’t understand”) and <strong>the work is submitted on time</strong>, it gets a “check”. Otherwise it gets an “x”. If you are stuck on an item, you’re expected to ask questions and give your best effort.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help on this assignment:</strong> <em>You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others’ answers.</em> Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.</p>
