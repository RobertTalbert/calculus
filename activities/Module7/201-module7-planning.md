# Module 7

Module 7 covers 3.1 and 3.2 -- really just 3.1, as 3.2 will be an AEP

+ Identify the global and local minimum and maximum values of a function, given the function's graph.
+ State the definition of _critical number_ and identify all the critical numbers of a function given the function's graph.
+ Find all the critical numbers of a function algebraically using derivatives.
+ State the First Derivative Test and the Second Derivative Test.  
+ Use the First Derivative Test to determine whether a critical number of a function is a relative minimum, relative maximum, or neither.
+ Use the Second Derivative Test to determine whether a critical number of a function is a relative minimum or relative maximum.
+ Identify the inflection points of a function, given the function's graph.
+ Use the second derivative to find all inflection points of a function algebraically.
