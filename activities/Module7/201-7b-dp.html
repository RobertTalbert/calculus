<h2 id="daily-preparation-module-7b-the-second-derivative-test-and-concavity">Daily Preparation, Module 7B: The Second Derivative Test and Concavity</h2>
<p><strong>Due by:</strong> 11:59pm ET, Tuesday, October 20</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time requirement:</strong> About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. <em>If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you’re not at least halfway done, DON’T work any further</em> — instead, <em>stop and ask for help</em> on the <code>#dailyprep</code> channel on CampusWire.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this module we extend the idea of the First Derivative Test from Module 7A to accomplish the same thing but using the second derivative instead. When the second derivative of a function can be calculated easily, it gives us a simpler way to classify critical numbers as local extrema — using a procedure known as the <strong>Second Derivative Test</strong>. While we’re thinking about second derivatives, in Module 7B we’ll also learn about using the second derivative to pinpoint concavity behavior of a function’s graph.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p><strong>Learning Targets addressed in this module:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DA.1</strong>  <strong>(CORE)</strong>: I can find the critical values of a function, determine where the function is increasing and decreasing, and apply the First and Second Derivative Tests to classify the critical points as local extrema.</li>
<li><strong>DA.2</strong>: I can determine the intervals of concavity of a function and find all of its points of inflection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>(<em>Review</em>) Identify where a function is concave up or concave down by examining its graph.</li>
<li>(<em>Review</em>) Given information about the sign of the second derivative of a function at a point, state whether the function is concave up or concave down at that point.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DURING AND AFTER</strong> your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Second Derivative Test to determine whether a critical number of a function is a relative minimum or relative maximum.</li>
<li>Use the second derivative of a function to determine its intervals of concavity and inflection points.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources-for-learning">Resources for Learning</h2>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> In the <em>Active Calculus</em> text, read in <a href="https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-3-1-tests.html">Section 3.1</a> starting with Example 3.1.10 and continuing through the end. There is a video walkthrough for Example 3.1.10 that you should watch either just before or just after reading that example.</p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> First watch these from the GVSUMath Calculus playlist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screencast 3.1.6: The Second Derivative Test (8:53) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z_lhNVXEV4&amp;list=PL9bIjQJDwfGuXQHuS5Jkmum_CFILoCZX-&amp;index=60">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z_lhNVXEV4&amp;list=PL9bIjQJDwfGuXQHuS5Jkmum_CFILoCZX-&amp;index=60</a></li>
<li>Screencast 3.1.7: Identifying inflection points graphically (7:03) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyyo8kILvE0&amp;list=PL9bIjQJDwfGuXQHuS5Jkmum_CFILoCZX-&amp;index=61">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyyo8kILvE0&amp;list=PL9bIjQJDwfGuXQHuS5Jkmum_CFILoCZX-&amp;index=61</a></li>
<li>Screencast 3.1.8: Finding inflection points (7:31) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_O9IKmDZMI&amp;list=PL9bIjQJDwfGuXQHuS5Jkmum_CFILoCZX-&amp;index=62">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_O9IKmDZMI&amp;list=PL9bIjQJDwfGuXQHuS5Jkmum_CFILoCZX-&amp;index=62</a></li>
</ul>
<p>THEN, watch this video which is a walkthrough of Example 3.1.10 in the reading:</p>
<p><a href="https://gvsu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=544276df-e3ea-484b-9868-ac4f00ce94fd">https://gvsu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=544276df-e3ea-484b-9868-ac4f00ce94fd</a></p>
<p>This is also embedded on Blackboard in the <em>Module 7</em> folder.</p>
<p>You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The exercises are on this Google Form: <a href="https://bit.ly/3iGRmmk">https://bit.ly/3iGRmmk</a></p>
<h2 id="submission-grading-and-getting-help">Submission, grading, and getting help</h2>
<p><strong>Submitting your work:</strong> Just work through the activities; your work is saved as you go.</p>
<p><strong>How this is graded:</strong> Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of <em>completeness and effort</em>: If your submission has <strong>all parts completed</strong> (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and <strong>a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given</strong> (no responses of “I don’t know” or “I didn’t understand”) and <strong>the work is submitted on time</strong>, it gets a “check”. Otherwise it gets an “x”. If you are stuck on an item, you’re expected to ask questions and give your best effort.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help on this assignment:</strong> <em>You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others’ answers.</em> Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.</p>
