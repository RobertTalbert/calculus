# MTH 201: Calculus

## Daily Preparation, Module 10B: Riemann sums

**Due by:** 11:59pm ET, Sunday, November 15

**Estimated time requirement:** About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. *If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you're not at least halfway done, DON'T work any further* --- instead, *stop and ask for help* on the `#dailyprep` channel on CampusWire. 

## Overview 

In Module 10A, we learned that we can estimate the distance traveled by a moving object with a known velocity, by estimating the area between its velocity curve and the horizontal axis. In Module 10B we introduce a systematic way to construct these estimates known as a **Riemann sum**. It's nothing mysterious --- just the method we saw of sticking rectangles under the curve and adding up their areas --- but it leads to a breakthrough in answering the "distance traveled" question that we'll encounter in Module 11. 

## What you will learn 

**Learning Targets addressed in this module:** 

-   **INT.1:** I can calculate the area between curves, net change, and displacement using geometric formulas and Riemann sums.


**BEFORE** your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following: 

- Calculate a sum that's given in "sigma" notation. 
- Estimate the area under a curve using a small number of rectangles whose heights are determined using left, right, and middle points. 

**DURING AND AFTER** your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Explain the general process of setting up a Riemann sum. 
- Calculate a simple left, right, and middle Riemann sum by hand. 
- Determine whether a Riemann sum will be an overestimate or underestimate of the true area under a curve. 
- Use a computer to set up and calculate a larger Riemann sum.

**Text:** In the _Active Calculus_ text, [read Section 4.2](https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-4-2-Riemann.html). 

You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.


## Exercises

The exercises are on Desmos. Go to [student.desmos.com](http://student.desmos.com) and you should see the Daily Prep for Module 10A. 

## Submission, grading, and getting help 

**Submitting your work:** Just work through the activities; your work is saved as you go. 

**How this is graded:** Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of *completeness and effort*: If your submission has **all parts completed** (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and **a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given** (no responses of "I don't know" or "I didn't understand") and **the work is submitted on time**, it gets a "check". Otherwise it gets an "x". If you are stuck on an item, you're expected to ask questions and give your best effort.  

**Getting help on this assignment:** *You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others' answers.* Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.
