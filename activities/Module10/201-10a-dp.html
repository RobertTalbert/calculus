<h2 id="daily-preparation-module-10a-determining-distance-traveled-from-velocity">Daily Preparation, Module 10A: Determining distance traveled from velocity</h2>
<p><strong>Due by:</strong> 11:59pm ET, <strong>TUESDAY</strong>, November 10</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time requirement:</strong> About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. <em>If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you’re not at least halfway done, DON’T work any further</em> — instead, <em>stop and ask for help</em> on the <code>#dailyprep</code> channel on CampusWire.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>With Module 10 we change gears to study the last big concept of this course. We’re going to study the question of, <strong>If we know how fast an object is moving, how far does it travel on a given time interval?</strong> This is sort of the opposite of the question we started the course with in August — <em>Given the position of a moving object, how fast is it moving?</em> — and we’ll answer it by building a new tool that is related to, but quite different from the derivative. We start that process here by going back to basic geometry.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p><strong>Learning Targets addressed in this module:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>INT.1:</strong> I can calculate the area between curves, net change, and displacement using geometric formulas and Riemann sums.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given the graph of a moving object’s velocity, estimate the distance it traveled over a time interval using a rectangle sum.</li>
<li>Define the term <em>antiderivative</em> and identify an antiderivative of a given function.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DURING AND AFTER</strong> your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given the graph of a moving object’s velocity (which varies over time), estimate the distance it traveled over a time interval using a rectangle sum.</li>
<li>Use an antiderivative to compute the distance traveled by an object, given a formula for its velocity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Text:</strong> In the <em>Active Calculus</em> text, <a href="https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-4-1-velocity-distance.html">read Section 4.1</a>.</p>

<p>You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The exercises are on Desmos. Go to <a href="http://student.desmos.com">student.desmos.com</a> and you should see the Daily Prep for Module 10A.</p>
<h2 id="submission-grading-and-getting-help">Submission, grading, and getting help</h2>
<p><strong>Submitting your work:</strong> Just work through the activities; your work is saved as you go.</p>
<p><strong>How this is graded:</strong> Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of <em>completeness and effort</em>: If your submission has <strong>all parts completed</strong> (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and <strong>a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given</strong> (no responses of “I don’t know” or “I didn’t understand”) and <strong>the work is submitted on time</strong>, it gets a “check”. Otherwise it gets an “x”. If you are stuck on an item, you’re expected to ask questions and give your best effort.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help on this assignment:</strong> <em>You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others’ answers.</em> Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.</p>
