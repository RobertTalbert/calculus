# MTH 201 Module 10

- Part A: 4.1
- Part B: 4.2


The only LT this time is

-   INT.1: I can calculate the area between curves, net change, and displacement using geometric formulas and Riemann sums.


Micro objectives: 

+ Use area to estimate or compute the distance traveled by an object, given a graph of its velocity.
+ Determine whether one function is an antiderivative of another.
+ Use an antiderivative to compute the distance traveled by an object, given a formula for its velocity.
+ Estimate the area between a curve and the horizontal axis on an interval using a left, right, and middle Riemann sum.

## Part A: 

- Given the graph of a moving object's velocity, estimate the distance it traveled over a time interval using a rectangle sum. 
- Define the term *antiderivative* and identify an antiderivative of a given function. 
- Use an antiderivative to compute the distance traveled by an object, given a formula for its velocity.

---

Pre class: 
- ID antiderivatives given the formula
- Do a simple area sum to estimate distance travelled 

In class activities: 

- Estimate distance travelled using area sums
- Find distance travelled using antiderivatives
- Same as above but the velocity can be negative 
- Make the connection that area is basically the opposite of
