# Module 11

Introduces the definite integral. 
- Part A: What the integral is and how to estimate and calculate it using area. Also properties of the integral and average value (for the followup) 
- Part B: Introducing the FTC -- what motivates it, what it says, how it's used (basically through Activity 4.4.2); do Activity 4.4.3 as the FA

Then the remainder of section 4.4 is Module 12. 

+ State the formal definition of the definite integral of a function on an interval and explain the meaning of each part of the notation.
+ Find the exact value of a definite integral using known geometric formulas (if possible).
+ Use the Properties of the Definite Integral to compute, manipulate, and simplify definite integrals.
+ Calculate the average value of a function on an interval.
+ State the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
+ Find the most general antiderivative of a function.
+ Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find the exact value of a definite integral using an antiderivative.

## Part A
