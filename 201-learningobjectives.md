+ Find the limit of a function as the input approaches a point, using tables and graphs. 
+ Find the limit of a function as the input approaches a point, using algebraic simplification. 
+ Find the instantanous velocity of a moving object by setting up and computing a limit.

### Module 2: What is a derivative? (1.3, 1.4)

+ State the formal definition of the derivative of a function on an interval.
+ Interpret the meaning of a derivative in terms of instantaneous velocity and the slopes of tangent and secant lines.
+ Compute the derivative of a function at a point by setting up and evaluating the limit in its definition.

### Module 3: What information does the derivative give us? (1.5, 1.6)

+ If a function is given with units for the input and output, state the units of the derivative. 
+ Estimate the value of a derivative at a point using forward, backward, and central difference calculations. 
+ Interpret the meaning of the derivative of a function that models a real-life situation, in terms instantaneous rates of change.
+ Determine whether a function is increasing, decreasing, or constant on an interval by examining the sign of its derivative. (Conversely, state the sign of a function's derivative using information about whether the function is increasing, decreasing, or constant.)
+ State the definition of the second derivative of a function.
+ Explain the meaning of the terms _concave up_ and _concave down_ and explain the connection between concavity of a function and its first and second derivatives.  
+ Determine whether a function is concave up or concave down on an interval by examining its graph.
+ Given the graph of a function,  make a reasonable sketch of the graph of its second derivative.
