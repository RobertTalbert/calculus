# MTH 201 Learning Objectives

## Course level objectives

+ State the definition of a derivative of a function, and use the definition to compute or estimate the derivative of a function.
+ Interpret the meaning of the derivative in accessible terms, and use derivatives to determine information about a function.
+ Compute the derivative of basic functions (constant, power, polynomial, and exponential functions as well as the sine and cosine functions) and basic combinations of functions (constant multiples, sums, products, quotients, and compositions).Â + Apply basic derivative computation methods to differentiate trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions and implicit functions, and compute limits having an indeterminate form.
+ Apply derivative computation methods to solve practical and real-world quantitative problems.
+ Compute Riemann sums of a function, and use Riemann sums to determine total change from a given rate of change.
+ Explain the definition of a definite integral, and use a definite integral to compute the total change of a function from the rate of change, and to compute area.
+ State and explain the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
