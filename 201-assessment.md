# Assessment plan

## Individual assessments 

+ Guided Practice -- due Sunday and Tuesday 11:59pm; preparation for upcoming module parts. Graded Pass/No Pass on basis of completeness, effort, and meeting the deadline. Plan on 24 of these. 
+ Application/Extension Problems (AEPs) -- single deadline/quota system. Post as many as possible at the beginning. Graded EMRN. Planning on 8-10 of these. 
  + Optimization (Core) 
  + Related Rates (Core) 
  + Family of functions (Core) 
  + Total change (Core) 
  + Basic function modeling w/ real data 
  + Local linearization 
  + Finding info on functions (Core) 
+ Learning Targets -- need to iron out the details, see below. 
+ WeBWorK -- 3x per week, due Wed/Fri/Sun. 5 questions each. Graded on points. 180 points total (with possible bonus at the end). 
+ Engagement credits -- 1 point each for Pass/No Pass work on active learning for class and other items. 100 points total. 


## Initial grade scheme 

| Item | D    |  C   | B   | A   | 
|:--:  | :--: | :--: |:--: |:--: |
| Learning Targets | Proficient on 12 | Mastery on all 10 Core + Proficient on 8 more | Mastery on all 10 Core and 5 others + Proficient on 6 more | Mastery on all 10 Core and 8 others + Proficient on 6 more |
| Application/Extension Problem Sets | "M" on 2 | "M" on 5 | "M" on 4, "E" on 2 | "M" on 3, "E" on 4| 
Guided Practice (24) | Satisfactory on 12 | Satisfactory on 16 | Satisfactory on 18 | Satisfactory on 20 |
WeBWorK (180 points) | 90 | 120 | 140 | 160 |
Engagement Credits (100 points) | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 


- Also: Passing the Functions Bootcamp  is required for a grade of C or higher. (Special exam + special WeBWorK)  
- Base grade is the highest grade for which *all* requirements have been met. 
- 





For AEP: Maybe require optimization and one other for C or above. 

## Learning Target assessments 

- Group F targets are mastered by passing the Functions Bootcamp assessment with 8/10 or higher and then completing a WeBworK set with a certain grade or higher by a certain time 
- Use a McNulty Style approach for everything but the Group F targets. 
  - Checkpoint 1: Comes after group L and roughly 1.4, consists of targets up through finding the derivative with the definition
  - Checkpoint 2: Contains all previous learning targets plus the rest of group DM 
  - Checkpoint 3: Contains all previous learning targets plus DS
  - Checkpoint 4: Contains all previous learning targets plus DA up through optimization
  - Checkpoint 5: Contains all previous learning targets plus rest of DA 
  - Checkpoint 6: Contains all previous learning targets plus FTC
  - Checkpoint 7: All previous learning targets one more time 
  - Final checkpoint @ final exam 
- Each attempt gets a check or an X. 
- Each target: 
  - Mastery: Two checks
  - Proficient: One check
  - Otherwise marked "Not yet" 
- To get a check:  
  - Do acceptable work on a checkpoint OR
  - Do acceptable work in a video conference OR 
  - Do acceptable work making a video 
- Rules for videos: 
  - No more than one standard per week (Mon-Fri)
  - Recorded video: Whatever I did before -- voice, handwriting, and physical presence in the frame at all times etc. 
- Mastery of all Core targets required for C or higher
