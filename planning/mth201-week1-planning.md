# Week 1


## 1A


+ Compute the average velocity of a moving object on an interval using either of the average velocity formulas.
+ Explain the differences between average velocity and instantaneous velocity.
+ ---
+ Find the instantanous velocity of a moving object through a sequence of average velocities.
+ Find the average rate of change in a function on an interval. 
+ Find the instantaneous rate of change in a quantity through a sequence of average rates of change. 

Day 1: 

+ The Meijer problem -- to find instantaneous velocity, look at a sequence of average velocities 
+ Practice 

Day 2: 

+ Expanding this to rate of change in general
+ Average rate of change --> Instananeous rate of change with an example 


## 1B 

+ Explain in words with the notation $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L}$ means. 
+ Explain in words with the notation $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = L}$ and $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = L}$ means. 
+ Explain in words with the notation $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L}$ and $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = L}$ mean. 
+ Determine the limit of a function using graphs. 
+ Determine one-sided limits of a function using tables and graphs. 
+ Determine limits at infinity of a function using tables and graphs. 

---

+ Determine the limit of a function using tables. 
+ Determine the limit of a function using algebra. 
+ Find the instantanous velocity of a moving object by setting up and computing a limit of a difference quotient. 



Day 1: Basic notions of two-sided limits, and using limits to find velocity. COncept of the difference quotient
