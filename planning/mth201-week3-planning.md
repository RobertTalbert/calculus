# Week 3



+ Compute the derivative of a function at a point by setting up and evaluating the limit in its definition.
+ State the formal definition of the derivative of a function.
+ Given the graph of a function, make a reasonable sketch of the graph of its derivative.
+ Compute the formula for the derivative of a function by setting up and evaluating the limit in its definition.



## Module 2A

### Day 1

+ State the formal definition of the derivative of a function at a point. 
+ Interpret the meaning of a derivative in terms of instantaneous velocity.
+ State the units of a derivative. 
---
+ Interpret the meaning of a derivative in terms of the slope of a tangent line. 
+ Compute the value of the derivative at a point using the definition. 

Class work: 

- Review 
- Minilecture: Explaining the formula for a derivative and what the derivative tells you
- Then activity: 
	- Polling: Which is a correct interpretation? Which are the correct units? What is the value of the derivative given the tangent line? 
	- jamboard: Setting up and evaluating the derivative of a function at a point

### Day 2

Focus on practice with the concepts from Day 1: 

- Setting up and evaluating the limit to get a derivative 
- Finding the value of a derivative at different points given a graph
