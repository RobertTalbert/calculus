# MTH 201: Calculus 

## START HERE 

**Welcome to Calculus**! I'm Robert Talbert, a professor in the Mathematics Department, and I am grateful that you are signed up for the course and am looking forward to working with you this semester. 

Before reading any further, here are some first things to know: 

1. **My highest priority this semester is your success in this course.** I am committed to helping you be successful in MTH 201 this semester. "Success" means more than just good grades. It means that you are being **challenged** to grow as a learner, that you are **engaging actively** with tasks that feed your growth, and that you are creating **excellent work** in mathematics by completing challenging Calculus-related tasks with a appropriate level of support. It also means that you are **building your lifelong learning skills** so that once the course is over, you are better and stronger as a learner and can continue to **learn new things independently**, and especially go on to **success in courses that have MTH 201 as a prerequisite**. 
2. **College level mathematics is more than just computation.** On the pathway to "success" as outlined above, you will be asked to do more than just perform computations. You will be working on **explaining the meaning** of mathematical processes and results in oral and written forms to different audiences; **working on realistic applications** of basic skills to authentic problems; **extending basic ideas** to more advanced concepts; and **seeking true understanding** of underlying concepts. In fact, many of the computations you might do with algebra in high school level mathematics will be automated through computers in MTH 201, and your work will mostly focus on these higher-level tasks. 
3. **You can expect to be challenged intellectually throughout this course.** None of these elements of "success" come easily. They require dedicated devotion of time and energy to wrestling with the concepts and tasks in the course. This will require you to leave your comfort zones on a regular basis. You may find that you need to rewire your entire process for learning things. You will need to stay constantly engaged with the course through participation in class meetings and on the class discussion board --- asking questions, seeking understanding, and giving help.  
4. **Intellectual struggle is normal and healthy in a challenging course.** Since none of this is easy, you can expect at times to feel like you are really struggling with the material --- even if in your earlier math courses you might never have experienced struggle. **This is normal and healthy.** Legitimate struggle is actually a sign you are doing things right, and it's a signal you're about to experience explosive growth. When you are building physical muscles, the point at which you are growing the most is the moment you experience the greatest strain and fatigue. **Our class is a safe place for you to experience those struggles.** 
6. **You have a lot of help available to you as you work.** Throughout the semester, you will be challenged but also given a lot of support to help you rise to the challenge. I will be readily available to help in several channels; your classmates will be available for help through structured and informal support groups; and the GVSU Math Department provides free help through the Math Center. **Everyone in the course has your back.** 
7. **You will find MTH 201 to be very enjoyable if you embrace the challenge.** Although hard work doesn't always feel good in the moment, by embracing the challenge and committing to learning Calculus, I think you will find that **growth is fun** and **Calculus is really interesting stuff**.

**Office:** My office is **Mackinac Hall C-2-513**. However, all student meetings this semester will be conducted online unless you have a specific need that requires a physical meeting. 

**Open drop-in hours:** **Monday through Thursday, 1-1:50pm**, using the link [http://gvsu.edu/s/1qX](http://gvsu.edu/s/1qX) and password **growthmind**. **You do not need an appointment.** If you cannot attend open drop-in hours, you can contact me by email, through a Campuswire direct message, or by scheduling an appointment at http://rtalbert.youcanbook.me. 

**Availability:** I typically only check email and other messages between 6am and 6pm on weekdays and once on Saturday mornings. If you send a message that needs a response during those times, you can expect to get a response within 6 hours. Otherwise you can expect one when I am back online. 

**Face-to-face Meetings**: Your section is split into two groups ("Red" and "Blue") and the different groups take turns meeting face-to-face (F2F) and working online. The time and location of your F2F meetings depends on your section and group: 

| Section |  Red group  | Blue group | 
|:------: | :--: | :---: | 
| 02 | Monday/Wednesday 10:00-10:50am, Mackinac Hall D-1-135 | Tuesday/Thursday 10:00-10:50am, Mackinac Hall D-1-135 
| 04 | Monday/Wednesday 3:00-3:50pm, Mackinac Hall A-1-165 | Tuesday/Thursday 3:00-3:50pm, Mackinac Hall A-1-165

**Textbook:** *Active Calculus* (2018 edition) by Matt Boelkins. The textbook is freely available online at https://activecalculus.org/ACS.html. **This online version is preferred.** There is also a PDF version available, and instructions for ordering a printed copy, at https://activecalculus.org/. 

**Course website and discussion board:** All course announcements, assignments, and grades will be communicated using the course **Blackboard** site available at http://mybb.gvsu.edu. All other course communications will be available through **Campuswire**, our class discussion tool; to join, go to https://campuswire.com/p/GAD2DF67E and use the code ``7913``. 

**Course calendar:** A Google Calendar, will all due dates and other important time-sensitive information posted on it, is available on Blackboard  in the left sidebar. **Be sure to check the calendar once daily** for upcoming events. The calendar is kept up-to-date constantly and **in cases of apparent conflicts in times or dates, the calendar is considered to be correct always.** 

**Technology:** To use the course tools, you will need to have access to the following: 

+ **A laptop or tablet device**, preferably one with a **touchscreen that allows writing on the screen with a stylus**. Please plan on bringing this device with you to all F2F meetings. 
+ **A modern web browser**. Chrome is preferred, but browsers such as Firefox and Edge are also fine. 
+ **Reliable access to high-speed internet**. 
+ **An active GVSU network account** so that you can access email, Blackboard, and Google Docs.

## Course overview and expectations 

**Learning objectives:** By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Use **functions** and other pre-Calculus mathematics proficiently.
- Calculate, use, and explain the concept of **limits**.
- Explain and interpret the meaning of the **derivative** of a function.
- Use **shortcuts** to calculate derivatives efficiently.
- Use derivatives to solve authentic real-life **application problems**.
- Use **definite integrals and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** to find areas and total change.

A full list of official departmental objectives for MTH 201 can be found [here](https://www.gvsu.edu/cms4/asset/9A420BCF-BA9E-0845-91754145EA82C51F/sor_descriptions_objectives__topics_for_faculty_updated_12-11-19.pdf). 

Your progress toward these course objectives will be tracked using **Learning Targets**. There are 23 individual Learning Targets covering all the major skills in the course; a complete list of these is at the end of this syllabus. 

**Structure and flow of the course:**  Your work in the class will follow a pattern that will involve you **before**, **during**, and **after** our meetings:

+ **BEFORE each class**: You'll complete a **Daily Prep** assignment in which you'll get familiar with the basic concepts of the upcoming lesson. Daily Prep assignments will typically be due by 11:59pm ET the night before the lesson; you'll be able to work ahead if you want. 
+ **DURING each class**: Class meetings will typically start with 10 minutes for going over the Daily Prep assignments and fielding  questions. Then we will spend around 30 minutes doing activities together on the harder concepts from the material. Then we will typically spend 10 minutes wrapping up, going through some of the main points of the activity, taking short ungraded quizzes to give you feedback on your learning, and getting your feedback on the lesson. 
+ **AFTER each class**: Only about half the lesson is covered during the in-class session. The rest of the lesson is learned through **Followup Activities** that you will do asynchronously (outside of class on your own schedule). 

This pattern repeats for each F2F meeting that you have with your group. Visually, the workflow looks like this:

Finally, there is ongoing work outside the flow of class meetings, such as online homework and application/extension problems. 

**Student expectations:** All students in the course are expected to do the following: 

- **Check email, Blackboard announcements, and Campuswire posts at least once a day** --- preferably more often for information, hints, questions, and engagement opportunities. Especially, given the unpredictable nature of the ongoing pandemic, it's imperative that you stay
