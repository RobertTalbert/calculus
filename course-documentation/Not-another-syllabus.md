# MTH 201: Calculus 

## START HERE 

**Welcome to Calculus**! I'm Robert Talbert, a professor in the Mathematics Department, and I am grateful that you are signed up for the course and am looking forward to working with you this semester. 

Before reading any further, here are some first things to know: 

1. **My highest priority this semester is your success in this course.** I am committed to helping you be successful in MTH 201 this semester. "Success" means more than just good grades. It means that you are being **challenged** to grow as a learner, that you are **engaging actively** with tasks that feed your growth, and that you are creating **excellent work** in mathematics by completing challenging Calculus-related tasks with a appropriate level of support. It also means that you are **building your lifelong learning skills** so that once the course is over, you are better and stronger as a learner and can continue to **learn new things independently**, and especially go on to **success in courses that have MTH 201 as a prerequisite**. 
2. **College level mathematics is more than just computation.** On the pathway to "success" as outlined above, you will be asked to do more than just perform computations. You will be working on **explaining the meaning** of mathematical processes and results in oral and written forms to different audiences; **working on realistic applications** of basic skills to authentic problems; **extending basic ideas** to more advanced concepts; and **seeking true understanding** of underlying concepts. In fact, many of the computations you might do with algebra in high school level mathematics will be automated through computers in MTH 201, and your work will mostly focus on these higher-level tasks. 
3. **You can expect to be challenged intellectually throughout this course.** None of these elements of "success" come easily. They require dedicated devotion of time and energy to wrestling with the concepts and tasks in the course. This will require you to leave your comfort zones on a regular basis. You may find that you need to rewire your entire process for learning things. You will need to stay constantly engaged with the course through participation in class meetings and on the class discussion board --- asking questions, seeking understanding, and giving help.  
4. **Intellectual struggle is normal and healthy in a challenging course.** Since none of this is easy, you can expect at times to feel like you are really struggling with the material --- even if in your earlier math courses you might never have experienced struggle. **This is normal and healthy.** Legitimate struggle is actually a sign you are doing things right, and it's a signal you're about to experience explosive growth. When you are building physical muscles, the point at which you are growing the most is the moment you experience the greatest strain and fatigue. **Our class is a safe place for you to experience those struggles.** 
6. **You have a lot of help available to you as you work.** Throughout the semester, you will be challenged but also given a lot of support to help you rise to the challenge. I will be readily available to help in several channels; your classmates will be available for help through structured and informal support groups; and the GVSU Math Department provides free help through the Math Center. **Everyone in the course has your back.** 
7. **You will find MTH 201 to be very enjoyable if you embrace the challenge.** Although hard work doesn't always feel good in the moment, by embracing the challenge and committing to learning Calculus, I think you will find that **growth is fun** and **Calculus is really interesting stuff**.
