<p>Welcome to week 6 and Module 5! This week we'll be extending our derivative-taking toolbox to include two important cases --- when we're *multiplying* two functions together and when we're *dividing* two of them.</p>

<p>Our schedule for the week is:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Monday/Tuesday:</b> Module 5A will introduce the **Product Rule** and **Quotient Rule** for differentiating products and quotients of functions. We'll learn those rules in the Daily Prep assignment then practice them with a variety of functions in our class work. </li>
    <li><b>Wednesday/Thursday:</b> Module 5B will apply the Quotient Rule to build up derivative formulas for the remaining four trigonometric functions --- tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some class announcements for this week:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>AEP completion incentive plan:</b> Make sure you've read through the announcement from Friday about this.</li>
    <li><b>Week 6 survey:</b> You'll be getting a survey this week asking for your input on the direction of the class so far. Please keep an eye out for it and fill it out when you receive it.</li>
    <li><b>Checkpoint 3:</b> Checkpoint 3 will be available at 4:00pm on Thursday, and due at 4:00pm on Friday. It will feature new versions of all Learning Targets you've seen so far (F.2, L.1, D.1, and D.2) and introduce three new Learning Targets: <b>D.3, D.4 and DC.1</b>. More information on this in a separate announcement on Monday. </li>
</ul>

<p>Here's what's due this week:</p>

    <li><b>Sunday 10/11:</b> Daily Prep Module 6A; WeBWorK Module 5; 10/11 is also the first deadline for the AEP completion bonus -- if you submit at least one AEP by this date and it is graded at R or above, you earn 5 PE credits. </li>
</ul>


<p>Here's a suggested work plan for the week. As always, this assumes you are putting aside 2 hours per weekday for work on MTH 201; if you can do that, and stick to the plan, you'll be free and clear for the weekend.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Monday:</b> 30 minutes to get started on Daily Prep for Module 5B; 30 minutes to get started with WeBWorK for Module 5; 30 minutes to work on an AEP (new draft or a revision); then spend the remaining 30 minutes on your choice of class tasks. </li>
    <li><b>Tuesday:</b> 30 minutes to complete Daily Prep 5B; 30 minutes on an AEP; 30 minutes on the WebWorK for Module 5; 30 more minutes on your choice of class tasks. </li>
    <li><b>Wednesday:</b> 30-45 minutes to complete Followup for Module 5A; 30 minutes on WeBWorK for Module 5; 30 minutes on an AEP; 30 minutes checking in with Campuswire and asking questions.</li>
    <li><b>Thursday:</b> 30 minutes to start Followup for Module 5B; 30 minutes for WeBWorK; then an hour on Checkpoint 3. You should plan on submitting your work after an hour --- limit yourself and you'll get more done.  </li>
    <li><b>Friday:</b> 30 minutes to finish up Checkpoint 3 (it's due at 4pm); 30 minutes to complete Followup for Module 5B; 30 minutes to complete WeBWorK; 30 minutes to complete Daily Prep for Module 6A.   </li>
</ul>
