## About this course and the syllabus

Welcome to MTH 201: Calculus. (Blurb about the course)

**Official course description:** A development of the fundamental concepts of calculus using graphical, numerical, and analytical methods with algebraic and trigonometric functions of a single variable. Limits and continuity, derivatives, indefinite integrals, definite integrals, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus; applications of derivatives and integrals. Fulfills Foundations - Mathematical Sciences. Offered every semester. *Prerequisites*: MTH 122 and MTH 123; or MTH 124; or assignment through Grand Valley math placement.

## Course information

**Meetings**: Due to social distancing requirements, this course is being conducted in a *staggered hybrid* mode in which each section is split into two groups, called the "Red" group and the "Blue" group. The time and location of your face-to-face (F2F) meetings depends on your section and group: 

| Section |  Red group  | Blue group | 
|:------: | :--: | :---: | 
| 02 | Monday/Wednesday 10:00-10:50am, Mackinac Hall D-1-135 | Tuesday/Thursday 10:00-10:50am, Mackinac Hall D-1-135 
| 04 | Monday/Wednesday 3:00-3:50pm, Mackinac Hall A-1-165 | Tuesday/Thursday 3:00-3:50pm, Mackinac Hall A-1-165

**Instructor**: Robert Talbert, Ph.D., Professor of Mathematics. 

**Instructor availability:** My office is Mackinac Hall C-2-513; however due to public health concerns, **all student meetings this semester will be conducted remotely** unless you have a specific need that requires a physical meeting outside of class. Open drop-in hours will be held *(insert times here)* through Google Meet, using the link *(insert link here)*. **You do not need an appointment for open drop-in hours; just click the link to join.** (You may be put into a waiting room if there is a meeting in process.) Outside those hours, you can contact me: 

+ By setting up an appointment for a video meeting. Go to http://rtalbert.youcanbook.me and choose any open time slot. 
+ Through a direct message on CampusWire, our class discussion tool. 
+ Through email at talbertr@gvsu.edu. 

**Note on availability:** Please note that in order to devote time to family, rest, and religious observances, **I typically only check email and other messages between 6am and 6pm on weekdays and once on Saturday mornings**. If you send a message that needs a response during those times, *you can expect to get a response within 6 hours*. Otherwise you can expect one when I am back online. Please plan accordingly --- for example, do not send messages after 6pm with the expectation of an immediate response. **If you have a question and it can be made public, you'll get a much faster response if you post it to CampusWire instead**. 

**Textbook:** We will use *Active Calculus* (2018 edition) by Matt Boelkins. The textbook is freely available online at https://activecalculus.org/single/frontmatter.html. There is also a PDF version available, and instructions for ordering a printed copy, at  https://activecalculus.org/. **The online version is preferred.** 

**Technology:** A significant portion this course will be conducted online. We will use several technological tools to make this work, all of which will be provided and are free to use. However, you will need to have access to the following in order to use those tools and complete your work: 

+ **A laptop or tablet device**, preferably one with a **touchscreen that allows writing on the screen with a stylus**. Please plan on bringing this device with you to your F2F meetings, as you may need to interact with students who are participating remotely. 
+ **A modern web browser**. Chrome is preferred, but browsers such as Firefox and Edge are also fine. 
+ **Reliable access to high-speed internet**. 
+ **An active GVSU network account** so that you can access email, Blackboard, and Google Docs. 

If you have any issue with accessing any of these, please let me know as soon as possible. 


## What will I learn and how will I learn it? 

### Course objectives and learning targets

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Use **functions** and other pre-Calculus mathematics proficiently.
- Calculate, use, and explain the concept of **limits**.
- Explain and interpret the meaning of the **derivative** of a function.
- Use **shortcuts** to calculate derivatives efficiently.
- Use derivatives to solve authentic real-life **application problems**.
- Use **definite integrals and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** to find areas and total change.

A full list of official departmental objectives for MTH 201 can be found [here](https://www.gvsu.edu/cms4/asset/9A420BCF-BA9E-0845-91754145EA82C51F/sor_descriptions_objectives__topics_for_faculty_updated_12-11-19.pdf). 

Your progress toward these course objectives will be tracked using **Learning Targets**. There are 24 individual Learning Targets covering all the major skills in the course; a complete list of these is in Appendix ??? at the end of this syllabus. Your grade in the course will be based in large part on the amount and quality of evidence you can provide, through various forms of work, that you've mastered these Learning Targets. 

### Structure and workflow of the course 

The course content is divided up into 12 **modules**, each of which takes about one week to complete. Each module is further split up into a "Part A" and a "Part B". Typically, Part A of a module will be the focus of classwork in the first half of a week; and then Part B, building upon Part A, is the focus of the second half. A complete list of Modules and the content they cover is found in Appendix ??? at the end of this syllabus.

Class work on each part of a module follows a simple schedule:

+ Before the beginning of a part of a module, students complete a **Daily Prep** assignment to learn the basic ideas; this is done online and turned in prior to any group meetings. 
+ The Red group will meet F2F to do active work on applications and extensions of the basics. This meeting will cover about half of the lesson. For the other half, Red group will complete asynchronous online activities that pertain to the remainder of the lesson. 
+ The Blue group does exactly what the Red group does, only shifted forward by one day. 

In a typical week, this pattern will happen twice, once for each part of the module. There are other things you will be doing outside of this workflow, which are discussed in the "What will I do to learn?" section. 

Here is a diagram that shows how it all fits: 

### How to learn 

**You can only learn mathematics, or anything else, by doing.** Therefore the vast majority of your experience in this course will be one of *active learning* where you are interacting with an activity, with other students, or both to build your own understanding of the concepts. **Calculus is not something that you can simply receive from an instructor; it has to be built.** 




### How to be successful 

**I want you to be successful in this course**. I will do my utmost to help you do this, by creating and maintaining a learning environment based on challenge and support and giving my highest professional commitment to your success and well-being. But, **but I cannot do success for you**. This comes from cooperation with me, interaction with your classmates, and diligent effort throughout the course. 

To be successful in the course, you need to make sure you are always giving an effort to do the following: 

+ **Staying engaged in the class** by preparing well for upcoming modules and class meetings, interacting with others and asking and answering questions, and avoiding all forms of procrastination. 
+ **Maintaining awareness of course information** by checking email, Blackboard announcements, and Campuswire posts at least twice a day. 
+ **Committing appropriate time to the course.** This is a 4-credit course, which means you should plan on spending at least 8-12 hours per week --- or 2-3 hours per weekday --- *at minimum*, working mindfully on the course through working on assignments and interacting with others. 
+ **Taking initiative to seek help** when you are stuck or have a question using open drop-in hours, Campuswire, study/support groups, and whatever else works for you.
+ **Maintaining a positive attitude** about the class and what you are learning. I know this is hard in such difficult times, but it's a discipline we all have to practice in order to get better.
