# MTH 201: Calculus 

*^ Replace with course banner*

## START HERE 

Welcome to MTH 201: Calculus! I'm Robert Talbert, a professor in the Mathematics Department, and I am grateful that you are signed up for the course and am looking forward to working with you this semester. 

Before reading any further, here are some first things to know: 

1. **My highest priority this semester is your success in this course.** I am committed to helping you be successful in MTH 201 this semester. "Success" in the course is more than just good grades. It means that you are being **challenged** to grow as a learner, that you are **engaging actively** with tasks that feed your growth, and that you are creating **excellent work** in mathematics by completing challenging Calculus-related tasks with a appropriate level of support. It also means that you are **building your lifelong learning skills** so that once the course is over, you are better and stronger as a learner and can continue to **learn new things independently**, and especially go on to **success in courses that have MTH 201 as a prerequisite**. 
2. **College level mathematics is more than just computation.** On the pathway to "success" as outlined above, you will be asked to do more than just perform computations. You will be working on **explaining the meaning** of mathematical processes and results in oral and written forms to different audiences; **working on realistic applications** of basic skills to authentic problems; **extending basic ideas** to more advanced concepts; and **seeking true understanding** of underlying concepts. In fact, many of the computations you might do with algebra in high school level mathematics will be automated through computers in MTH 201, and your work will mostly focus on these higher-level tasks. 
3. **You can expect to be challenged intellectually throughout this course.** None of these elements of "success" come easily. They require dedicated devotion of time and energy to wrestling with the concepts and tasks in the course. This will require you to leave your comfort zones on a regular basis. You may find that you need to rewire your entire process for learning things. You will need to stay constantly engaged with the course through participation in class meetings and on the class discussion board --- asking questions, seeking understanding, and giving help.  
4. **Intellectual struggle is normal and healthy in a challenging course.** Since none of this is easy, you can expect at times to feel like you are really struggling with the material --- even if in your earlier math courses you might never have experienced struggle. **This is a normal and healthy experience.** When you are building physical muscles, the point at which you are growing the most is the moment you experience the greatest strain and fatigue. Legitimate struggle is actually a sign you are doing things right, and it's a signal you're about to experience explosive growth. **Our class is a safe place for you to experience those struggles.** 
5. **You have a lot of help available to you as you work.** Throughout the semester, you will be challenged but also given a lot of support to help you rise to the challenge. I will be readily available to help in several channels; your classmates will be available for help through structured and informal support groups; and the GVSU Math Department provides free help through the Math Center. **Everyone in the course has your back.** 
6. **You will find MTH 201 to be very enjoyable if you embrace the challenge.** Although hard work doesn't always feel good in the moment, by embracing the challenge and committing to learning Calculus, I think you will find that **growth is fun** and **Calculus is really interesting stuff**.

## Course information

**Instructor**: Robert Talbert, Ph.D., Professor of Mathematics. Email: talbertr@gvsu.edu. Phone: ???

**Instructor availability:** My office is Mackinac Hall C-2-513; however due to public health concerns, **all student meetings this semester will be conducted remotely** unless you have a specific need that requires a physical meeting outside of class. Open drop-in hours will be held *(insert times here)* through Google Meet, using the link *(insert link here)*. **You do not need an appointment for open drop-in hours; just click the link to join.** (You may be put into a waiting room if there is a meeting in process.) Outside those hours, you can contact me by email or phone, through a direct message on Campuswire, or by scheduling an appointment at http://rtalbert.youcanbook.me. 

**Limits on availability:** Please note that **I typically only check email and other messages between 6am and 6pm on weekdays and once on Saturday mornings**. If you send a message that needs a response during those times, *you can expect to get a response within 6 hours*. Otherwise you can expect one when I am back online. Please plan accordingly --- for example, do not send messages after 6pm with the expectation of an immediate response. **If you have a question and it can be made public, you'll get a much faster response if you post it to CampusWire instead**. 

**Face-to-face Meetings**: This course is being conducted in a *staggered hybrid* mode in which your section is split into two groups, called the "Red" group and the "Blue" group, and the different groups take turns meeting face-to-face (F2F) and working online. The time and location of your F2F meetings depends on your section and group: 

| Section |  Red group  | Blue group | 
|:------: | :--: | :---: | 
| 02 | Monday/Wednesday 10:00-10:50am, Mackinac Hall D-1-135 | Tuesday/Thursday 10:00-10:50am, Mackinac Hall D-1-135 
| 04 | Monday/Wednesday 3:00-3:50pm, Mackinac Hall A-1-165 | Tuesday/Thursday 3:00-3:50pm, Mackinac Hall A-1-165

**Textbook:** We will use *Active Calculus* (2018 edition) by Matt Boelkins. The textbook is freely available online at https://activecalculus.org/single/frontmatter.html. There is also a PDF version available, and instructions for ordering a printed copy, at  https://activecalculus.org/. **The online version is preferred.** 

**Course website and discussion board:** All course announcements, assignments, and grades will be communicated using the course **Blackboard** site available at http://mybb.gvsu.edu All other course communications (including additional examples, guidance on assignments, etc.) will be available through **Campuswire**, our class discussion tool; to join, go to http://www.campuswire.com and use the code ???. 

**Course calendar:** A Google Calendar for the course, will all due dates and other important time-sensitive information posted on it, is available on Blackboard through a link in the left sidebar. **Be sure to check the calendar once daily** for upcoming events. The calendar is kept up-to-date constantly and **in cases of apparent conflicts in times or dates, the calendar is considered to be correct always.** 

**Technology:** To use the course tools, you will need to have access to the following: 

+ **A laptop or tablet device**, preferably one with a **touchscreen that allows writing on the screen with a stylus**. Please plan on bringing this device with you to all F2F meetings. 
+ **A modern web browser**. Chrome is preferred, but browsers such as Firefox and Edge are also fine. 
+ **Reliable access to high-speed internet**. 
+ **An active GVSU network account** so that you can access email, Blackboard, and Google Docs. 

We will use a variety of course tools during the semester, but these are free to use, and you will be taught how to use them as part of the class. If you have any issue with accessing any of the above, please let me know as soon as possible. 

**What Calculus is about:** Calculus is the mathematical study of change. Quite frequently we care not only about *how much* there is of a certain quantity but *how fast it is changing* at a given point in time. Case in point: The current Covid-19 pandemic. The number of Covid-19 cases in the USA is important, but at least as important is the rate at which that number is growing or shrinking right now. Calculus starts with simple geometry and introduces the important concept of the *limit* to develop an entire language, focused on the *derivative* and the *definite integral*, that allows us to describe and calculate change. 

**Course content:** We will cover chapters 1-4 of the *Active Calculus* text. Key topics to be studied include: understanding functions from the perspective of calculus, the concept of limit, the definition and meaning of the derivative, computing derivatives, using derivatives in applications, antiderivatives and definite integrals and their meaning, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In every topic, we seek a **conceptual understanding** from several perspectives, the ability to **apply ideas**, development of **logical reasoning and communication skills**, and an **appreciation for calculus as a whole**.

**Official course description:** A development of the fundamental concepts of calculus using graphical, numerical, and analytical methods with algebraic and trigonometric functions of a single variable. Limits and continuity, derivatives, indefinite integrals, definite integrals, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus; applications of derivatives and integrals. Fulfills Foundations - Mathematical Sciences. Offered every semester. *Prerequisites*: MTH 122 and MTH 123; or MTH 124; or assignment through Grand Valley math placement.

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Use **functions** and other pre-Calculus mathematics proficiently.
- Calculate, use, and explain the concept of **limits**.
- Explain and interpret the meaning of the **derivative** of a function.
- Use **shortcuts** to calculate derivatives efficiently.
- Use derivatives to solve authentic real-life **application problems**.
- Use **definite integrals and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** to find areas and total change.

A full list of official departmental objectives for MTH 201 can be found [here](https://www.gvsu.edu/cms4/asset/9A420BCF-BA9E-0845-91754145EA82C51F/sor_descriptions_objectives__topics_for_faculty_updated_12-11-19.pdf). 

Your progress toward these course objectives will be tracked using **Learning Targets**. There are 24 individual Learning Targets covering all the major skills in the course; a complete list of these is in Appendix ??? at the end of this syllabus. Your grade in the course will be based in large part on the amount and quality of evidence you can provide, through various forms of work, that you've mastered these Learning Targets. 

## Structure and flow of the course 

Your MTH 201 course is being offered in a **staggered hybrid** mode. "Staggered" means that while we will have F2F meetings regularly, we will stagger the attendance so that only about half the section is in attendance at any give meeting, for social distancing purposes. "Hybrid" means that the course is a combination of F2F work and asynchronous online work, with about a 50/50 split in our case. 

The content of MTH 201 is divided into 12 **modules**, each of which is subdivided into a "Part A" and a "Part B". A complete list of modules and the content they cover is in Appendix ??? at the end of this syllabus. Your engagement and work on each module follows a standard pattern: 

+ Before Part A of a module, you'll complete a **Daily Preparation** assignment that leads you through independent learning of the basic ideas of Part A. 
+ Then you will have a F2F meeting to do active work on applications and analysis of the basic information you learned in the Daily Preparation assignment. The F2F meetings happen over two days, with the "Red" group meeting the first day and the "Blue" group meeting the second day. The two groups' meetings will be identical (except for student questions, etc. that might vary by group). 
+ Your F2F meeting will only cover about half of the lesson for Part A. The remaining half will be covered by **Followup Activities** that are done asynchronously online. 
+ Finally, you'll complete a brief online homework set that covers Part A and reviews past material. 
+ Then this pattern repeats for Part B. 

Here is a diagram that shows how it all fits in a typical week:  

**Live streaming of F2F meetings:** All F2F meetings will be live-streamed over either Zoom or Google Meet. If you cannot attend one of your designated F2F meetings, you will have the option of participating remotely through the live stream. 

## Learning activities in MTH 201 

Both to learn the material and to demonstrate how well you have learned it, you will be engaging with several different kinds of activities in the course. Our course uses a **mastery grading** system in which **most graded items do not use points**, but rather your work will be required to meet certain levels of quality that demonstrate mastery. We will say much more about this in this syllabus and in class. 

The kinds of activities you will undertake are: 

+ **Daily Preparation**: You will complete Daily Prep assignments before each of your F2F meetings. Each Daily Prep assignment involves reading, video-watching, or playing with an interactive tool and then answering questions and working exercises on basic learning obejctives. Each Daily Prep is graded with a "check" if it is submitted by the deadline (given on the course calendar), every exercise has a response, and each response indicates a good-faith effort to be right. Otherwise the work receives an "x". 
+ **Followup Activities**: Following your face-to-face meeting, you'll complete a short set of activities roughly equivalent to an in-class group activity. Followup activities will complete the lesson for each part of a module. As with Daily Prep assignments, they are grade with a "check" if the activity is completed by the due date and each part of the activity is complete with a good-faith effort to be right. Otherwise it receives an "x".  
+ **WeBWorK**: Twice a week, students will complete 8-item online homework sets that provide opportunities to practice basic ideas from each part of a module and to review. These are deployed using the *WeBWorK* online homework system at https://webwork-math.gvsu.edu/webwork2/. These will be due Wednesday and Sunday nights at 11:59pm ET. WeBWork allows for unlimited multiple attempts without penalty up to those deadlines. Each WeBWorK item is worth 1 point (some allow partial credit) ad is auto-graded by the computer on the basis of correctness of the answer. 
+ **Learning Target Checkpoints**: On a roughly bi-weekly basis, you'll receive a take-home exam called a "Checkpoint" that consists of several problems, each one of which focuses on a single Learning Target from the list in Appendix ???. Each Checkpoint will contain one problem for every Learning Target that has been covered up to that point. For example, the first Checkpoint may contain problems for Learning Targets F.1 through L.2; the second Checkpoint will contain new versions of F.1 through L.2 along with first-time problems for D.1 through D.3; the third Checkpoint will contain new versions of F.1 through D.3 with first-time problems for D.4 through DC.1; and so on. You will only need to attempt problems for Learning Targets that you have not yet mastered. The cumulative structure allows you to attempt problems multiple times in different weeks. Students will be provided with a detailed rubric for what constitutes acceptable work on each Checkpoint problem. Work that meets the criteria for acceptable work will be given a "check"; work that does not meet the criteria will receive an "X". **Work receiving an "X" can be redone at any later Checkpoint**. See the Revision policy for details. You can also earn a "check" through means other than Checkpoints; see ??? for details. 
+ **Application/Extension Problems (AEPs)**: AEPs are more extensive problems that require applying or extending the basic course knowledge from the Learning Targets. Most require technology, and all will require a formal writeup. There will be at least 8 AEP sets posted during the semester. They are graded using the EMRN rubric discussed in a later section and can be revised and resubmitted if needed. 
+ **Final Exam**: The final exam in the course will consist of two parts. The first part consists of big-picture questions on the overall ideas of the course. Your performance on this part contributes to the plus/minus grade in the course. The other part of the final exam will be a last Checkpoint of the semester and will give you the chance to meet additional learning targets that have not yet been mastered. 
+ **Miscellaneous engagement opportunities**: Various other activities in the class will give you the opportunity to get and stay engaged with the course. These include the Startup assignment in week 1, occasional discussion board activities, meeting certain incentive bonus deadlines, and other items. Designated items will carry 1 "engagement credit", and engagement credits will accumulate through the semester. In particular, every "check" on a Daily Prep and Followup activity is worth 1 engagement credit. 

## How work is graded in MTH 201

### Proficiency and Mastery on Learning Targets 

There are 24 Learning Targets in the course, 10 of which are designated as **Core** targets due to their central nature in Calculus, and the other 14 of which are designated as **Supplemental**. There are two levels of achievement on any of the  Learning Targets: **Proficiency** and **Mastery**. Students get numerous opportunities to demonstrate understanding of the Learning Targets; every time this happens, the student receives a "check" on that Learning Target. 

+ To be rated as "Proficient" on a Learning Target, earn **one check** on it. 
+ To be rated as "Mastered" on a Learning Target, earn **two checks** on it. 

You can earn a check on a Learning Target in four different ways: 

1. *(The simplest way)* **Do work on a Checkpoint** that meets the criteria for acceptable quality, as described above,. 
2. **Schedule an oral assessment** (on videoconference) during which I will give a new version of a Checkpoint-like problem for that Learning Target, and you solve that problem "live" at an acceptable level. 
3. **Create a video** of yourself working out the solution to a Checkpoint-like problem that I will make for you, then submit the video. If you choose this option, you'll also be required to have a follow-up video meeting with me to discuss the solution and answer additional related questions to make sure you really understand the ideas. 
4. **Use work on an AEP set** and schedule a videoconference meeting with me to argue that your work on the AEP demonstrates mastery of the Learning Target, as well as answer follow-up questions. For example, you might do work on an AEP that you believe demonstrates proficiency with "computing derivatives correctly using multiple rules in combination" (Learning Target DC.3). If so, then you could schedule a meeting with me to explain why you think your work satisfied DC.3; I would listen and, if I agree, I might ask you to work out a second problem also related to DC.3 to make sure you really understand the idea. 

**Boundaries on these methods:** Please note the following restrictions on options 2-4 above: 

- *No more than one check per week can be earned through options 2-4*. 
- *Option 3 (make a video) must adhere to standards for video creation* (to be posted separately; basically the video must have clear sound and audio, and keep face, handwriting, and voice in the frame at all times). 
- *Mastery (two checks) *must* include at least one Checkpoint problem*. That is, you can't earn Mastery on a learning target through options 2-4 alone.

### The EMRN rubric

Work on Application/Extension Problems is graded not with points but with one of four designation: "E" (Excellent/Exemplary), "M" (Meets the standard), "R" (Needs revision), or "N" (Not assessible/Not enough information). The process of assigning these marks is shown below: 

![EMRN rubric](EMRN.png)

Whenever your work on an AEP is graded, you will be given extensive actionable feedback on what was done well and what needs improvement. 

### How your semester grade is determined 

Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to earn a particular letter grade, each requirement must be met in the column for that grade. Your *base grade* (the letter A,B,C, D, or F without plus or minus) is **the lowest grade for which all the requirements are met**. 

| Activity |  A | B | C | D | 
|:---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |
| Core LT | Mastery on all 10  | Mastery on all 10  | Mastery on 5, Proficiency on 5 | Proficiency on 5 |  
| Supplemental LT | Mastery on 6, Proficiency on 6 | Mastery on 3, Proficiency on 6 | Proficiency on 6 |
| AEP | 4 E, 4 M+ | 2 E, 4 M+ | 6 M+ | 3 M+ | 
| WW | 180+ points | 160+ points | 140+ points | 90+ points |  
| DP + FA | 
| EC | 90+ total | 80+ total | 70+ total | 60+ total | 


| Grade | Core LT | Supplemental LT | AEP | WW | DP+LA | EC | 
| :---: | :----: | :---: | :--: | :--:| :--: | :---: | 
| A | Mastery 10 | Mastery 6, Proficiency 6 |  3 E, 4 M+ | 180+ | 44+ | 90+ 
| B | Mastery 10 | Mastery 3, Proficiency 6 | 2 E, 4 M+ | 160+ | 39+ | 80+ 
| C | Mastery 5, Proficiency 5 | Proficiency 6 | 5 M+ |  140+ | 34+ | 70+ 
| D | Proficiency 5 | Proficiency 3 | 2 M+ | 90+ | 24+ | 48+ |

> OLD STUFF from here on down

### How to learn 

**You can only learn mathematics, or anything else, by doing.** Therefore the vast majority of your experience in this course will be one of *active learning* where you are interacting with an activity, with other students, or both to build your own understanding of the concepts. **Calculus is not something that you can simply receive from an instructor; it has to be built.** 




### How to be successful 

**I want you to be successful in this course**. I will do my utmost to help you do this, by creating and maintaining a learning environment based on challenge and support and giving my highest professional commitment to your success and well-being. But, **but I cannot do success for you**. This comes from cooperation with me, interaction with your classmates, and diligent effort throughout the course. 

To be successful in the course, you need to make sure you are always giving an effort to do the following: 

+ **Staying engaged in the class** by preparing well for upcoming modules and class meetings, interacting with others and asking and answering questions, and avoiding all forms of procrastination. 
+ **Maintaining awareness of course information** by checking email, Blackboard announcements, and Campuswire posts at least twice a day. 
+ **Committing appropriate time to the course.** This is a 4-credit course, which means you should plan on spending at least 8-12 hours per week --- or 2-3 hours per weekday --- *at minimum*, working mindfully on the course through working on assignments and interacting with others. 
+ **Taking initiative to seek help** when you are stuck or have a question using open drop-in hours, Campuswire, study/support groups, and whatever else works for you.
+ **Maintaining a positive attitude** about the class and what you are learning. I know this is hard in such difficult times, but it's a discipline we all have to practice in order to get better.
