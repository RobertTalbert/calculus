## Grading criteria and submission instructions

Please refer to the [overall quality standards for AEPs](https://hackmd.io/@rtalbert235/HkSbMs2Av) at the link (and posted to the *AEPs* area on Blackboard) first, and make sure your work meets all these criteria. In addition to the overall standards, this AEP has the following specific standards: 



| Mark: | Criteria:  |
| -------- | --------  |
| **E** (Excellent)     | Text          |
| **M** (Meets Expectations) | Text   | 

Please [see the syllabus](https://hackmd.io/@rtalbert235/SJ5fDZIAv#How-are-individual-assignments-graded) for how grades of **P** (Progressing) and **X** (Not Assessable) are assigned. 


To submit this AEP: 

- Create a **typed document** using a word processor utilizing an equation editor for any significant mathematical notation. **Submissions that are handwritten or contain any handwritten work without prior permission will be graded "X" and returned without comment.** 
- Save the document as a PDF. Please **do not submit Word (.doc, .docx) or Open Office (.odt) files** as these do not always render mathematical notation correctly on screen. 
- Upload the PDF to the appropriate AEP assignment in the *AEPs* area on Blackboard. **Remember to hit the "Submit" button after uploading**, otherwise your work is merely on the Blackboard server and not in the instructor's grading queue. 

Once graded, the grade (E, M, P, X) will appear in your gradebook. You can then open the submission to view feedback left by the professor. These appear as text comments on the page or as general comments next to the grade. Grades of E or M may not have much feedback. Grades of P or X *always* have feedback, so please look carefully for this. 

For information on revisions of AEPs, please [consult the syllabus](https://hackmd.io/@rtalbert235/SJ5fDZIAv#How-do-I-revise-and-resubmit-my-work).
