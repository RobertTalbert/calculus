There are 16 problem types that address the following learning objectives. Six (6) of these are labelled as \textbf{CORE} problems:  
	\begin{description}
		\item[Problem 0] Compute limits and determine continuity and differentiability of a function given a graph or table. 
		\item[Problem 1] Find average and instantaneous rate of change in a function using the limit-based definition of the derivative. 
		\item[Problem 2 (CORE)] Find the equation for the tangent line to the graph of a function at a point, and find the formula for the derivative of a function, using the limit-based definition of the derivative. 
		\item[Problem 3] Find a table of values for the first and second derivative of a function, when the original function is a table of values. 
		\item[Problem 4] Find and use the derivative of polynomial, power, and exponential functions. 
		\item[Problem 5 (CORE)] Find and use the derivative of a function using the Product and Quotient Rules. 
		\item[Problem 6] Find and use the derivative of functions involving trigonometric functions. 
		\item[Problem 7 (CORE)] Find and use the derivative of a function using the Chain Rule.
		\item[Problem 8] Find and use the derivative of functions involving logarithmic and inverse trigonometric functions.
		\item[Problem 9] Determine the derivative of an implicitly-defined function. 
		\item[Problem 10 (CORE)] Use algebraic methods to determine critical values, intervals of increase and decrease, local extrema, intervals of concavity, and inflection points of a function. 
		\item[Problem 11] Use algebraic methods to find the global extrema of a continuous function on a closed interval. 
		\item[Problem 12 (CORE)] Set up and solve  applied optimization problems. 
		\item[Problem 13] Set up and solve  applied related rates problems.

	\end{description}
Each midterm exam as well as the final exam will contain new instances of these basic types. The first midterm will contain instances of Problems 0--3. The second midterm will contain Problems 0--7. The third midterm will contain Problem 0 through approximately Problem 12, and the fourth midterm and final exam will contain instances of all 16 of these. In this way, you can get repeated tries at each problem until you attain mastery on these.
