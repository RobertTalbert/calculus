# MTH 201: Calculus

## Post-Class work for Module 1a: How do we measure velocity?

**Due by:** 11:59pm Eastern, Friday September 4

**Estimate time requirement:** 60-90 minutes. 

## Overview

In our in-class meeting on this module, we learned: 

- How to find the average velocity of a moving object over a time interval if we're given a function that tells us its position 
- That the average velocity over a time interval is the same as the slope of the line connecting two points on the position graph, namely the positions at the start and stop times 
- The concept of *instantaneous velocity*, which is the speed of an object at a single moment 
- That we find instantaneous velocity by looking at a sequence of average velocities over time intervals of shorter and shorter duration, and seeing if those average velocities "converge" on a single number

Since our MTH 201 course is a **hybrid** course, we won't have a second class meeting on Module 1a. Instead, you'll take the ideas from the in-class meeting to the next level through work done in this post-class assignment, which combines individual work and online group work. 

**Instructions:** The "Exercises" section has several tasks for you to complete. 

## Exercises 

1. Complete Activity 1.1.3 on your own, on separate pages. 
2.
