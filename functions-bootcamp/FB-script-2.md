# Script for Functions Bootcamp video 2

In the previous video we learned that quantities are all around us, many times they are related to each other and change in tandem, and sometimes those relationships are such that one quantity uniquely determines the other. That last kind of relationship is called a function. 

A function more formally is a process that may be applied to a collection of input values to produce a corresponding collection of output values in such a way that the process produces one and only one output value for any single input value.

Now let's discuss three different forms that functions can take on. A function can be represented in four different ways: 

- As data, where the two variables involved are given in a table or a spreadsheet, and the process for finding output is just to look it up in the table or spreadsheet; 
- As a graph, where the function is given as a kind of picture; 
- And as a formula, where the process of determining output from a given input is an algebraic computation that you perform. 

When we have a function, and we take input and use the function to determine the output, this is called **evaluating** the function. 

Let's look at an example, going back to the earlier example of running. I went on a long walk the other day and had my fitess tracker on, which I wear to monitor my heart rate 

First of all, heart rate is a function of time because if you were to give me a particular time to look at, I have all the information I need to process your request and tell you what my heart rate was at that time. Each time value has a heart rate value associated to it, and there is only one, not two or more, heart rates at any given time. 

As a set of data, here's a spreadsheet that I pulled from my fitness tracker. This tells you specifically what the heart rate was at any given time on the walk. To evaluate the function in this form, you just take the particular value of input or the independent variable, which is time, that you want and then just look up the output or dependent variable value in the table.  For example, at exactly 30 minutes my heart rate was 116 beats per minute. At exactly 75 minutes, it was 145 beats per minute. 

As a graph, this is what it looks like. When we represent a function as a graph, we always put the input or independent variable on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable on the vertical axis. To evaluate the function as a graph at a particular time, find the time value on the horizontal axis, find the point on the graph above or below it, then read off the value on the vertical axis. For example my heart rate after one hour was 113 beats per minute. You can also work backwards; right here for example it looks like my heart rate peaked at 178 beats per minute right around the 1 hour 25 minute mark. 

As a formula --- well, there really isn't going to be a formula that exactly represents the relationship here. It's just too complex and too noisy. But we do have computer tools that can take data and find approximate formulas for the data and use those approximations, although they introduce error because they are just approximations. If I had a formula though, I would evaluate it at a time value by replacing all the instances of the independent variable in the formula with the value of the input I was given, then do the math that results and give the result either in simplest exact form or as an approximation using decimals.  

You should always examine a function from all three points of view. Changing the representation of a function uncovers information that helps you understand its behavior. For example, here's a formula for a particular function, and if I asked you how this function behaves, it's kind of hard to say, but if you change it into a graph, all of a sudden it takes on some life. Changing representations usually involves the use of technology, so an important part of learning mathematics and studying functions is mastering the tools needed to examine functions from different points of view.
