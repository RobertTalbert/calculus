# Script for Functions Bootcamp video 2

In the previous video we learned that quantities are all around us, many times they are related to each other and change in tandem, and sometimes those relationships are such that one quantity uniquely determines the other. That last kind of relationship is called a function. 

A function more formally is a process that may be applied to a collection of input values to produce a corresponding collection of output values in such a way that the process produces one and only one output value for any single input value.

Now let's discuss four different forms that functions can take on. A function can be represented in four different ways: 

- As a verbal description, where the process of finding the output when you're given input is just a set of instructions; 
- As data, where the two variables involved are given in a table or a spreadsheet, and the process for finding output is just to look it up in the table or spreadsheet; 
- As a graph, where the function is given as a kind of picture; 
- And as a formula, where the process of determining output from a given input is an algebraic computation that you perform. 

Let's look at an example, going back to the earlier example of running. I went on a long walk the other day and had my fitess tracker on, which I wear to monitor my heart rate. 

First of all, heart rate is a function of time. My walk lasted 116 minutes. If you gave me a specific minute value into my walk, I can look at my data for heart rate and tell you the unique heart rate at that time. There's not two heart rates for any one given time. 

As a set of data, here's a spreadsheet that I pulled from my fitness tracker. This tells you specifically what the heart rate was at any given time on the walk. You just find the independent variable value and then look up the corresponding dependent variable value. For example, at exactly 30 minutes my heart rate was 116 beats per minute. At exactly 75 minutes, it was 145 beats per minute. 

As a graph, this is what it looks like. to get the output for a given input, find the time value on one axis and then look for the corresponding point on the graph. For examply my heart rate after one hour was 113 beats per minute. You can also work backwards; right here for example it looks like my heart rate peaked at 178 beats per minute right around the 1 hour 25 minute mark. 

As a formula --- well, there really isn't going to be a formula that exactly represents the relationship here. It's just too complex and too noisy. But we do have computer tools that can take data and find approximate formulas for the data and use those approximations, although they introduce error because they are just approximations. 

In separate videos we're going to take a closer look at each of these three representations of functions. For now, just realize three important principles: 

1. Changing the representation of a function yields information. For example, just looking at a data table for my long walk doesn't really tell you anything *about* the walk, but changing it to a graph makes a few things pop, and tells a story. Like for example, something was going on here that spiked my heart rate. What was it? Can you make up a story that explains it? 
2. All models are wrong, but some are useful. These different representations might tell different stories about the quantities that are involved, and some might hide information. So never rely on just one representation of a function but always look at every function from multiple viewpoints. 
3. Algebra isn't what math is all about. Most quantitative information in real life does NOT come to us as a formula. It comes as a graph or a table of data, and we can only give approximations using formulas. So when we move on to study real-world mathematics like Calculus, we need to keep in mind that it is not, and cannot be, all about algebraic computation. The important thing is to understand the concepts of what you are learning and how to communicate thought processes and results.
