So far in this series of videos, we've learned about what a function is, why it's important to see each function from three different points of view -- as data, as graphs, and as formulas, and how to evaluate functions in formula mode when the input is a number or an algebraic expression. In this video we're going to focus on functions represented as graphs. 

The graph of a function is just a picture that's made up of all the input-output pairs of the function with the independent or input variable on the horizontal axis and the dependent or output variable on the vertical axis. Please note, sometimes we call those the "X" and "Y" axes, but we should try to get in the habit of not using specific variable names and just calling these axes horizontal and vertical, just because our variables aren't always called "X" or "Y". 

To evaluate a function given as a graph, we take the input, find it on the horizontal axis, then find the point on the graph associated with it by looking up or down, then reading off the output value. For example, here's the graph of a function f(t). What's the value of f(2), for example? Well, I just find t = 2 on the horizontal axis and then look for where the graph sits above or below it, and the height value of the graph is the output. In this case, f(2) = 1. Likewise, what's f(0)? I go to t = 0 which is right here, then look for the graph, which sits at -1. So f(0) equals -1. 

Here's another example with a little weirder function, called g(t), that has different pieces to it. Pause the video and see if you can evaluate g(-2), g(0), g(1/2), and g(1). 

In each case we're going to go to the right place on the horizontal axis, then find the height of the graph. 

g(-2) is equal to -1. In fact the function always evaluates to -1 for every value of t less than 0. 
g(0) is equal to 2. It may be a little hard to see but at t = 0, the function switches pieces, so you might wonder if the function takes on two values here, -1 and +2. It can't do that, because remember a function cannot produce two outputs for a given input. That would be like the vending machine that gives you two candy bars for one money input -- nice, but broken. Instead if you look carefully there is an open circle at t = 0 and -1 on the vertical axis, and a filled in circle at t = 0 and +2 on the vertical axis. That filled in circle is telling you where the graph actually is. So here, g(0) =2. 

g(1/2) is a little easier -- at t = 1/2, I can see that the graph is at a height of 1. So g(1/2) = 1. 

g(1) is tricky. If I go to t = 1, the graph appears to touch the axis. But there's an open circle or a hole there. So technically there is no graph present right at t = 1. That means that there is no function output for an input of t = 1. What we say in this case, where a function can't be evaluated at a given point like t = 1 because there's no corresponding output, is that g(1) **does not exist**. In calculus, what we'll observe is that as t *approaches* 1, the output values *approach* 0, and this will have some meaning for us. But *at* t = 1 there is no function. 

So now you know how to evaluate a graph as a function, and how to tell if a function fails to exist at a point. Thanks for watching.
