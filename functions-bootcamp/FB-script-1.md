# Script for Functions Bootcamp video 1

Almost every situation you encounter in real life involves quantitative information in some way or another. 

Let's suppose for example you want to go for a run to get some exercise. The simple act of running involves a huge amount of numerical or quantitative data. Many of us who run wear these devices that capture these data. For example, you might keep track of 

- The time elapsed
- The distance you've traveled
- Your heart rate
- The number of calories you've burned 
- And much more. 

Although each piece of information about your run might be useful, it becomes more interesting and useful when you think about how pairs of quantities are related to each other. 

For example, if you look not just at distance you've covered but how that distance relates to the time that's elapsed, you can get a sense of your pace or how fast you've been moving. 

Or, you might look not just at the number of calories you've burned but how that number changes with your heart rate. A relationship between calories and heart rate might reveal some information about your exercise to you -- for example you might find the right "zone" for your heart rate that burns calories at the fastest rate. 

So one of the most useful things we can do with mathematics is to understand the relationships between quantities and express those relationships in ways that help us learn things, make predictions, and tell stories about those quantities. 

Just like in real life, not all relationships are created equal, and in mathematics the most useful kind of relationship between quantities is when a value of one quantity determines exactly one value of the other. 

Let's go back to running and specifically the way time and distance travelled relate to each other. There's two things that are especially nice about the relationship between time and distance. First, if you give me a particular time, I have all the information I need to process your request and give you the distance I had travelled at that time. So there's a clear way for me to come up with an "output" when you give me an "input". Second, and this is a little more subtle, when you give me a time as input, not only is it possible for me to give you an output, there is only one output that's possible. I can't be in two places at the same time, so there's a single, unique output for each input. 

Consider another relationship --- heart rate and calories burned. It seems like those are related, and they probably are, but the relationship is different. Suppose you wanted to know, how many calories I had burned when my heart rate was at a certain level, like 120 beats per minute. If you input the heart rate, can I tell you the calories? It's harder this time because although I might have some data that show a relationship between the two, I can't necessarily give you a single, unique output. If you ask me for the calories when my heart rate is 120 beats per minute, well, I might have been at 120 at the beginning of my run when I hadn't burned any calories, and again at the end of the run when I had burned a lot more. That one input of 120 gives two different outputs, so I can't give you a simple, clear answer to the question of how many calories I had burned when my heart rate was 120. 

So relationships between quantities where the input gives an output and the output is unique, are special. We call such relationships **functions.** More formally: 

**A function is a process that may be applied to a collection of input values to produce a corresponding collection of output values in such a way that the process produces one and only one output value for any single input value**.

This means that in a function, you start with an input, then the function is a process that tells you how to get the output, and not only will there be an output for each input, that output is unique. 

Think of a function like a vending machine. You input some money, and the output is a treat. When you put in the money, if the machine is "functioning" then it will actually give you something -- not just take your money. And also if the machine is functioning, when you put in your money and press the buttons, only one thing comes out -- not two. (It's nice when we get two treats for the price of one, but it means the machine is malfunctioning.

The input variable in a function is often called the *independent* variable and the output is called the *dependent* variable. They're both called "variables" because they can take on different values, and one depends on the other. 

Some examples: 

- In my running example, distance traveled is the dependent variable and time is the independent variable. We say that distance **is a function of** time. 
- But calories burned was not a function of heart rate, because if you give me a heart rate I can't tell you with certainty what the calorie count was. 

So now we've learned that quantities are everywhere, quite often they are related and the best kinds of relationships (just like in real life) are the functional ones. Functions are processes that take input (the independent variable) and show you how, through some sort of process, to produce an output (the dependent variable) from it and the output first of all exists (the function doesn't just take your money) and the output is unique (only one, not two outputs). 

Next up we'll talk about three important ways to represent functions and how to evaluate them. Thanks for watching.
