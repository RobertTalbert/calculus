We've come to the last video in this series and there's just one more item --- well, actually two more --- to talk about with respect to functions. It has to do with the inputs and outputs of functions. 

Take a look at the function f(x) = sqrt(x-2). We know how to evaluate this function at different points --- just plug in the input and do the math. For example f(6) is sqrt(6-2), which is sqrt(4), which is 2. And f(2) is sqrt(2-2), which is sqrt(0), which is 0. But also we need to note there are some inputs that don't work. For example, f(1) would be sqrt(1-2), which is sqrt(-1) .... but this doesn't exist as a real number. Likewise f(0) would be sqrt(-2) and that's nonexistent too. In fact it looks like any input that's less than 2 will end up putting a negative number under the root, which makes the output fail to exist. 

Likewise, just as there are numbers that can't happen as inputs to this function, there are numbers that can't happen as outputs of this function either. The function is calculated by taking a square root. The outputs of that root can be positive, and they can be 0, but they cannot be negative. The square root of a number is never negative. So the only outputs that can possible come out of this function are positive and zero numbers. 

The set of numbers that can be put into a function so that the outputs are computable, is called the **domain** of the function. For example our function f(x) = sqrt(x-2) has a domain of x >= 2 which you'll remember in interval notation is [2, infinity). We know this because any number less than 2, when input, causes the argument of the radical to be negative, and that's a no no. But any number 2 or larger will give either 0 or a positive number under the radical, which is OK. 

And the set of numbers that can *come out of* a function, is called the **range** of the function. Here, the sqrt(x-2) function can have any output at all between 0 and infinity, but it can never take on negative values. So the range of this function is [0, infinity). 

The domain and range of a function are very important for placing boundaries on the analysis of a function. For example, if you take this figure and fold up the edges, you get a box with an open top, and it turns out that if the height of the box is h, then its volume is given by this formula as a function of h. If we wanted to study this function, for example to find the value of h that gives us the greatest volume, then it's a big help to note that the domain of this function is (0, infinty) --- the only height values that make sense are positive ones, and we can skip looking at 0 or negative values of h because it doesn't make physical sense to have a box with a 0 or negative height. 

Here's an example for you to try. It's a function f(t) given as a graph. Pause the video and write out the domain and the range of f in interval notation. 

OK. So what is the domain here? Well, according to the graph, I can evaluate this function at any number from -3 and including -3, all the way up to 4 but not including 4. That's what the closed and open circles on the graph mean. So the domain of the function is [-3,4). 

For the range, look at it sideways. The outputs of this function literally range between 0 on the vertical axis up to 2, and it looks like both 0 and 2 are hit. So the range here is [0,2]. 

That does it for this video and the entire functions bootcamp series. You're now well on your way to being an expert on mathematical functions, so congratulations and thanks for watching.
