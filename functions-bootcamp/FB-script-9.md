So we've learned a lot about functions and how to work with them. It's often useful to look at the behavior of a function not at a single point but over an entire range of points, like for example in this picture the function f(x) is decreasing not just at x = 1 but for all x between 0 and 2. So how do we express entire ranges of points? That's what this video is about. 

We actually already know one way to express an entire range of points, and that's by using an inequality or a pair of inequalities. For example, I could refer to all the points between 0 and 2 by the inequality x is greater than 0 and less than 2. If I meant for 0 to be included in that range, I'd use a less than or equal to symbol and likewise if I wanted to include the 2. 

Or I see here that the function f(x) is increasing for all x greater than 2. I could use an inequality with that as well, by just writing x greater than 2. 

This is all fine, but it turns out there's a simpler and even more compact way to write sets of points like this, and that's with what we call an **interval**. 

In regular everyday language, an interval means a period of time, like the interval from 1pm to 3pm. It's a set of time values between two time values. In math it means much the same -- a set of numbers that are between two numbers, a start point and and ending point. 

We use what is called *interval notation* to write down intervals. The way this works is like this. To write an interval using interval notation, first write down the start point, then a comma, then the ending point. Now, if you want to include the starting point in your set, put a left square bracket around it. If you don't, and that point should be excluded, the use a rounded bracket which is a parenthesis. Similarly on the right, if the ending point should be included then use a right square bracket. Otherwise use a right parenthesis. 

Some quick examples: 

The interval from 0 to 2 that includes both 0 and 2 is written square bracket, 0, comma, 2, square bracket. When we include both endpoints of an interval, it's called a **closed interval**. This is the same set of points as what we would get from the inequalitity 0 <= x <= 2. 

If I meant for both 0 and 2 *not* to be in the interval, then I'd do the same but with parentheses. When we exclude both endpoints of an interval, it's called an **open interval**. This would correspond to the inequality 0 < x < 2. 

If I meant for 0 to be included but 2 not to be included, I'd use a square bracket on 0 and a rounded one on 2. This would be called a **half open interval**. This would correspond to the inequality 0 <= x < 2. 

So what if you have an interval that has a start point but no stopping point, like the inequality x >= 2. In this case we use the infinity symbol as one of the endpoints. For example, this interval consisting of all points x bigger than 2 would be written [2, infinity). Notice, we use a square bracket on the left because we are including the 2. But since infinity is not a number and has no location on the number line, it is NEVER included in an interval, so we always use a round bracket. 

Likewise the set of all points that would correspond to x < 5 would be the interval (-infinity, 5). This time rounded brackets are on both ends, since again we cannot include -infinity because it's not a number, but just a symbol that represents something that has no end; and we use a parenthesis around 5 because the inequality said to exclude it. 

If we need to take two intervals and join them together, we use the "union" symbol which looks like an uppercase U. (In fact you can just type an upper case U if you ever need to write it from the keyboard.) For example, here's a function that's positive from -2 to 1 and then again from 3 to infinity. That's not one interval but two, because intervals have no breaks in them. If I wanted to express this in interval notation, I'd write the first interval (-2,1) then the second (3, infinity) and then join them with the union symbol like so. This means the set of all numbers between -2 and 1, or bigger than 3. 

Here's a quick concept check. For each of these intervals, draw them on the number line, using an open circle when an endpoint is excluded and a closed one when it's included. For example this interval (3,5] would look like this. 

(1,3)
(-2, 4]
[1,4]
[1, infinity)

Here are the answers! 

The first one is the open interval from 1 to 3 so it's all numbers in between 1 and 3 but NOT 1 and NOT 3. 
The second one is from -2 to 4, and we include 4 but exclude -2. 
The third one is the closed interval from 1 to 4 so we include both. 
And finally the fourth one starts at 1, includes 1, and continues right forever. 

Thanks for watching.
