## Learning Targets 


**Group F: I can use functions and other pre-Calculus mathematics proficiently.** 

- F.1: I can read and use graphs, tables, and formulas to access relevant information within a problem. 
- F.2: I can use appropriate algebraic techniques and terminology, including function notation, to help me solve problems. 
- F.3: I can identify the fundamental algebraic structure of a function (product, composite, etc.). 

**Note**: All F targets are assessed and completed by passing the Functions Bootcamp Exam. 

**Group L: I can calculate, use, and explain the concept of limits.** 

- L.1*: I can evaluate the limit (including one-sided and infinite limits) of a function at a point using graphical, numerical, or algebraic methoDC or explain why a limit fails to exist.
