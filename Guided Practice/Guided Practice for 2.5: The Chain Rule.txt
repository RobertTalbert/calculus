# Guided Practice for 2.5: The Chain Rule

## Overview 
This section introduces a very important rule: The Chain Rule, which is used to differentiate *composite* functions. Composite functions are functions composed (hence the name) of two or more functions "chained" together in sequence, such as \( f(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)^{1/2}\). Many functions in applications are composites and so this rule gives us a much broader range of functions we can work with in calculus. The Chain Rule is also used as a basis for several upcoming concepts involving derivatives in which we have incomplete information about the functions involved. 

The Chain Rule is a Big Idea, and so we will actually be spending two entire meetings working with it. There are only two such sections  in the book where two days are planned for it! (The other is Section 3.4 on Applied Optimization.)

## Learning objectives 

### BASIC learning objectives
Each student will be responsible for learning and demonstrating proficiency in the following objectives PRIOR to the class meeting. **The entrance quiz for the class meeting will cover these objectives**. 

- (*Review*) Apply all the derivative rules from Sections 2.1--2.4 with fluency. 
- (*Review*) Identify composite functions (that is, functions of the form \(y = f(g(x)))\) and identify the “inner” and “outer” functions. 
- State the Chain Rule and explain how it works in English. 
- Identify situations where the Chain Rule should be used when taking a derivative. 
- Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a simple composite function, for example a composition of a polynomial and a power function (e.g., \( f(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)^{1/2}\)).

### ADVANCED learning objectives 
The following objectives should be mastered by each student DURING and FOLLOWING the class session through active work and practice: 

- Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a composite function involving two functions. 
- Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a composite function involving three or more functions. 
- Use the Chain Rule in combination with other rules from earlier in this chapter. 
- Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a composite function in which at least one of the functions in the composite is given as a graph or a table of values. 

 
## Resources
*Reading*: **Read Section 2.5, pp. 110–117  in Active Calculus**. We will work some of the Activities in class, but you may also work on them outside of class for further understanding. 

*Viewing*: Watch the following videos at the MTH 201 YouTube Playlist. This is a considerably longer list this time, because (1) many students find the Chain Rule hard to grasp, and so we've prepared lots of examples; and (2) this is a two-day unit and there are no videos to watch for the second meeting. These have a total running time of 41 minutes, 38 seconds:

Here are two optional videos if you need a refresher on the concept of a composite function:

## Exercises 
These exercises can be done during or after your reading and video watching. They are intended to help you make examples of the concepts you are reading and viewing. Work these out on scratch paper, and then you will be asked to submit the results on a web form at the end. 

In Preview Activity 2.5 you are asked to tell whether the "fundamental algebraic structure" of a function is a sum, product, quotient, or composition of functions; and if the function is a composition, give a formula for the inner function and a formula for the outer function. Here is a solution for part (a), given the function \( h(x) = \tan(2^x)\). The fundamental structure here is a composition, with the inner function being \(g(x) = 2^x \) and the outer function being \( f(x) = \tan(x) \).

Now you do the following: 

1. Work Preview Activity 2.5(b).
2. Work Preview Activity 2.5(c).
3. Work Preview Activity 2.5(d).
4. Work Preview Activity 2.5(e).
5. Work Preview Activity 2.5(f).
6. What specific mathematical questions do you have about the reading and viewing that you would like to discuss in class?
