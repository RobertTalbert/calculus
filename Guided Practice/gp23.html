<h1 id="guided-practice-2.3-the-product-and-quotient-rules">Guided Practice 2.3: The Product and Quotient Rules</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This section introduces two new derivative-taking rules: the <strong>Product Rule</strong> for differentiating functions of the form <span class="math">\(f(x) \cdot g(x)\)</span>, and the <strong>Quotient Rule</strong> for differentiating functions of the form <span class="math">\(\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}\)</span>. We'll learn these rules and a little bit about why they work, and then put them to work for us in doing computations.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain why the derivative of a product of two functions, <span class="math">\(f(x) \cdot g(x)\)</span>, is <em>not</em> just the product of the derivatives, <span class="math">\(f’(x) \cdot g’(x)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Explain why the derivative of a quotient of two functions, <span class="math">\(f(x)/g(x)\)</span>, is <em>not</em> just the quotient of the derivatives, <span class="math">\(f’(x)/g’(x)\)</span>.</li>
<li>State the Product Rule and use it in a simple situation.</li>
<li>State the Quotient Rule and use it in a simple situation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Differentiate a function for which the derivative involves a combination of the Product Rule, Quotient Rule, and other rules we've learned.</li>
<li>Use the Product and Quotient rules in the context of a real-world problem to find the slope of a tangent line, the instantaneous rate of change in a function, or the instantaneous velocity of an object.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In <em>Active Calculus</em>, read Section 2.3. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: Watch the following videos at the MTH 201 YouTube playlist (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus).</p>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Chuck is asked to take the derivative of the function <span class="math">\(y = x^2 \sin x\)</span> and ends up with <span class="math">\(\dfrac{dy}{dx} = 2x \cos x\)</span>. Is this right, or not? If not, what did Chuck do wrong, and what should the right derivative be?</li>
<li>Darla is asked to take the derivative of the function <span class="math">\(y = \dfrac{x^2}{x^2 + x + 1}\)</span> and comes up with <span class="math">\(\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \dfrac{2x}{2x + 1}\)</span>. Is this right, or not? If not, what did Darla do wrong, and what should the right derivative be?</li>
