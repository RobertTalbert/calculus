## Assessments/student work 

+ Learning Targets: 24 total, 10 of which are Core
+ AEP sets: Could be 12+, at least 10
+ Pre-class: 24 
  + They count for engagement credits but also a certain number must be completed 
+ Final exam
+ WeBWork (treat 180 as the max) 
  + Using model of 5/5/10 = 25 points per module: 300 points
  + Using model of 8/8 = 16 points per module: 192 points <-- Let's go with this model
+ Engagement credits (treat 100 as the max)

  + Startup assignment (20)

## Learning Target mastery

There are 24 Learning Targets in the course, 10 of which are Core (so 14 others). 

+ Targets are assessed by students showing work that demonstrates skill that meets the quality standards of the course. (Detailed rubrics will be available along with samples.)
+ Meeting the standard on that work earns a "check" for the Learning Target. 
+ Two levels of achievement on each LT: 
  + Progressing: One check mark
  + Mastered: Two check marks. 
+ How to earn a check: 
  + Checkpoints: Occasional take-home exams with problems to work out and turn in. (Final exam included)
  + Oral checkpoints: Make an appointment and do a live oral exam on a checkpoint problem over video. 
  + Video solutions: Make a video of working out a solution. 
  + Work on an AEP set: Submit portion of work on AEP along with argument, and then do a video followup. 
  + Suggest your own
+ Rules about this: 
  + No more than two checks may be earned in any given week through methods other than Checkpoints. 
  + No more than one check per target may be earned through methods other than Checkpoints. So "Progressing" can be earned through any method at all, but "Mastered" requires at least one Checkpoint.
