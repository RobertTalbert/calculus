# Daily Prep 9B -- MTH 201-04

## Overview 

Module 9B continues the thread started in Module 9A with **applied optimization problems**. We will be looking at optimization problems that go beyond some of the basics that you've seen so far. 

## Learning objectives 

These are the same as for Module 9A! 


## Resources for learning

No additional reading or viewing is required. 

## Exercises 

The exercises for this Daily Prep are found on student.desmos.com. 


## Submission and grading 


A **Pass** mark is given if the Daily Prep is turned in before its deadline and if each item on the Daily Prep has a response that represents a good faith effort to be right. **Mistakes are not penalized**. A **No Pass** is given if an item is left blank (even accidentally), has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if the Daily Prep is late.
