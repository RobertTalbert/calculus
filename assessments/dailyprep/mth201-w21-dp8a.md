# Daily Prep 8A -- MTH 201-04

## Overview 

Module 8 is a continuation of the concepts of Module 7 where we analyzed the behavior of a function by finding and classifying its critical values and examining its concavity; it's also an important setup for Module 9, where we look at applied problems involving finding the "best" values of a function. In Module 8A we introduce the **Extreme Value Theorem**, which states that every continuous function has an absolute/global maximum and minimum function if it's constrained to a closed interval. This mathematical result gives us a simplified process for finding global max and min values of functions. 

## Learning objectives 

**Basic Learning Objectives:** *Before* our class meeting, use the Resources listed below to learn all of the following. You should be reasonably fluent with all of these tasks prior to our meeting; we will field questions on these, but they will not be retaught. 

+ (*Review*) Find the critical values of a function using its first derivative, and classify them using the First or Second Derivative Tests. 
+ (*Review*) State the definition of a **closed interval**. 
+ (*Review*) State informally what it means for a function to be **continuous on a closed interval**.
+ State the **Extreme Value Theorem** and explain the three-step process it provides for finding the absolute extreme values of a continuous function on a closed interval. 


**Advanced Learning Objectives:** *During and after* our class meeting, we will work on learning the following. Fluency with these is not required prior to class. 

+ Apply the Extreme Value Theorem to find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a closed interval. 
+ Given an applied setting, build a function that models the situation; identify a closed interval for its domain; then identify its absolute maximum and minimum values on the interval. 


## Resources for learning

**Reading:** In the _Active Calculus_ text, read [Section 3.3](https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-3-3-optimization.html).

## Exercises 

The exercises for this Daily Prep are found on student.desmos.com. 


## Submission and grading 

To submit your work, simply do the work in Desmos. 

A **Pass** mark is given if the Daily Prep is turned in before its deadline and if each item on the Daily Prep has a response that represents a good faith effort to be right. **Mistakes are not penalized**. A **No Pass** is given if an item is left blank (even accidentally), has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if the Daily Prep is late.
