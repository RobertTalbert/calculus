# Daily Prep 12A -- MTH 201-04

## Overview 

We've made it to the final module of the course! In Module 12, we'll continue to build on the concept of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Module 12A is mainly a review and extension of the ideas from Module 11B --- the Fundamental Theorem itself, and how to compute definite integrals with it (and apply the concepts to real problems). 

## Learning objectives 

**Basic Learning Objectives:** *Before* our class meeting, use the Resources listed below to learn all of the following. You should be reasonably fluent with all of these tasks prior to our meeting; we will field questions on these, but they will not be retaught. 


+ (*Review*) State the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
+ (*Review*) Find the most general antiderivative of a function.
+ (*Review*) Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find the exact value of a definite integral using an antiderivative.

**Advanced Learning Objectives:** *During and after* our class meeting, we will work on learning the following. Fluency with these is not required prior to class. 


## Resources for learning

**Video:** No video to watch this time. Re-watch any ones from Module 11B where you feel you might need extra review. 

**Text:** Re-read [Section 4.4 in the Active Calculus text](https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-4-4-FTC.html).

## Submission and grading 

To submit your work, simply submit the Google Form. You will receive a receipt via email to confirm your submission. (Look in your spam folders if you do not see the receipt.) 

A **Pass** mark is given if the Daily Prep is turned in before its deadline and if each item on the Daily Prep has a response that represents a good faith effort to be right. **Mistakes are not penalized**. A **No Pass** is given if an item is left blank (even accidentally), has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if the Daily Prep is late.
