# Daily Prep 4B -- MTH 201-04

## Overview 

In Module 4B, we'll add to our toolbox of basic derivative rules by adding in the two basic **trigonometric functions** $y = \sin(x)$ and $y = \cos(x)$. Having their derivatives available to us will allow us to find rates of change in functions that oscillate back and forth (systems of springs, market prices, temperature patterns, etc.). 


## Learning objectives 

**Basic Learning Objectives:** *Before* our class meeting, use the Resources listed below to learn all of the following. You should be reasonably fluent with all of these tasks prior to our meeting; we will field questions on these, but they will not be retaught. 

- *Trigonometry review*: State the values of $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ for the 16 special angles shown on the unit circle. 
- State the derivatives of the functions $y = \sin(x)$ and $y = \cos(x)$. 

**Advanced Learning Objectives:** *During and after* our class meeting, we will work on learning the following. Fluency with these is not required prior to class. 

- Calculate derivatives of basic combinations of $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$. 
- Use basic derivative rules to solve problems about slopes, velocities, and rates of change involving $\sin(x)$, $\cos(x)$, and simple combinations of these two functions with other elementary functions. 


## Resources for learning

**Reading:** Read through [Section 2.2](https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-2-2-sin-cos.html) of the *Active Calculus* textbook. Work through the examples and all interactive exercises found at the end of the section.  

**Video:** No videos required this time.

## Exercises 

The exercises for this Daily Prep are on Desmos, student.desmos.com.


## Submission and grading 

To submit your work, simply submit the Google Form. You will receive a receipt via email to confirm your submission. (Look in your spam folders if you do not see the receipt.) 

A **Pass** mark is given if the Daily Prep is turned in before its deadline and if each item on the Daily Prep has a response that represents a good faith effort to be right. **Mistakes are not penalized**. A **No Pass** is given if an item is left blank (even accidentally), has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if the Daily Prep is late.
