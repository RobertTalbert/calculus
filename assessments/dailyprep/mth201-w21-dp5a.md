# Daily Prep  5A -- MTH 201-04

## Overview 

Now that we've learned "shortcut" methods for basic functions, we'll be learning some derivative rules for more complicated combinations of those functions. We begin with the **Product Rule** for differentiating a product of two functions and the **Quotient Rule** for differentiating a quotient of two functions. 

## Learning objectives 

**Basic Learning Objectives:** *Before* our class meeting, use the Resources listed below to learn all of the following. You should be reasonably fluent with all of these tasks prior to our meeting; we will field questions on these, but they will not be retaught. 

-   State the Product Rule and Quotient Rule.
-   Use the Product Rule to differentiate products of basic functions.
-   Use the Quotient Rule to differentiate quotients of basic functions.


**Advanced Learning Objectives:** *During and after* our class meeting, we will work on learning the following. Fluency with these is not required prior to class. 

-   Use derivative rules (including the Product and Quotient Rule, but also older rules) to solve problems about slopes, velocities, and rates of change involving basic functions.

## Resources for learning

**Reading:** Read through [Section 2.3]([https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-2-3-prod-quot.html](https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-2-3-prod-quot.html) of the *Active Calculus* textbook. **You can just skim the discussion at the beginning of 2.3.1 and start paying full attention at the box titled "Product Rule".** Work through the examples and all interactive exercises found at the end of the section. 

**Video:** Watch the following from the GVSUMath Calculus playlist:

## Exercises 

The exercises for this Daily Prep are in a Desmos activity. Go to student.desmos.com and look for "MTH 201 Daily Prep 5A".  


## Submission and grading 

To submit your work, simply submit the Google Form. You will receive a receipt via email to confirm your submission. (Look in your spam folders if you do not see the receipt.) 

A **Pass** mark is given if the Daily Prep is turned in before its deadline and if each item on the Daily Prep has a response that represents a good faith effort to be right. **Mistakes are not penalized**. A **No Pass** is given if an item is left blank (even accidentally), has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if the Daily Prep is late.
