# Daily Prep 6A -- MTH 201-04

## Overview 

This module introduces the final and perhaps most important derivative rule we will learn in the course: **The Chain Rule**. The Chain Rule is used when taking derivatives of *composite* functions, which you'll recall are functions that are made up of two or more functions "chained" together by plugging one into the other, like $\sqrt{x^2 + 1}$ or $\cos(e^x)$. The commonality of composites in real applications makes the Chain Rule of primary importance as we move ahead. 

## Learning objectives 

**Basic Learning Objectives:** *Before* our class meeting, use the Resources listed below to learn all of the following. You should be reasonably fluent with all of these tasks prior to our meeting; we will field questions on these, but they will not be retaught. 

+ (Review) Determine the fundamental algebraic structure of a function. 
+ (Review) If the fundamental algebraic structure of a function is a *composite*, determine the inner and outer functions in the composite. 
+ State the Chain Rule and apply it to a simple composite function. 

**Advanced Learning Objectives:** *During and after* our class meeting, we will work on learning the following. Fluency with these is not required prior to class. 

+ Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a composite of two basic functions.
+ Differentiate a function whose derivative involves a mixture of rules (Product, Quotient, Chain, etc.)


## Resources for learning

**Because of the amount of video examples this time, I recommend doing the video first and then read later.**

**Reading:** Read through [Section 2.5](https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-2-5-chain.html) of the *Active Calculus* textbook.  Work through the examples and all interactive exercises found at the end of the section.

**Video:** There's quite a bit of video to watch this time -- if you watch all of these below, the complete running time is 51 minutes, 20 seconds. (You are *not* required to watch all of them --- you can pick and choose, skip parts, play at 2x speed, etc. but these are here for you to learn, so don't skip just to avoid working.) **You should approach these videos as if they were an entire, single class meeting of nothing but lecture and examples**. 

First, review the two videos on composite functions and fundamental algebraic structure that were made for the Precalculus Review assignment during startup week. You can find those on Blackboard > *START HERE* > *Precalculus Review Assignment* > *Tutorial Videos* and then these are videos 7 and 8. Or click the links:

You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.

## Exercises 

The exercises for this Daily Prep are found on Desmos. Go to student.desmos.com and look for "MTH 201 Daily Prep 6A". 


## Submission and grading 

To submit your work, simply submit the Google Form. You will receive a receipt via email to confirm your submission. (Look in your spam folders if you do not see the receipt.) 

A **Pass** mark is given if the Daily Prep is turned in before its deadline and if each item on the Daily Prep has a response that represents a good faith effort to be right. **Mistakes are not penalized**. A **No Pass** is given if an item is left blank (even accidentally), has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if the Daily Prep is late.
