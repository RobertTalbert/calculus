# Daily Prep 5B -- MTH 201-04

## Overview 

With the Product and Quotient Rules under our belts, we can now add some more derivative rules to our toolbox --- specifically, we can now find the derivatives of the remaining six trigonometric functions of **tangent**, **cotangent**, **secant**, and **cosecant**. That's the focus of Module 5B along with getting more practice on using the Product and Quotient Rules in general.  

## Learning objectives 

**Basic Learning Objectives:** *Before* our class meeting, use the Resources listed below to learn all of the following. You should be reasonably fluent with all of these tasks prior to our meeting; we will field questions on these, but they will not be retaught. 

- *Trigonometry review*: State the definitions of the functions $\tan(x)$, $\cot(x)$, $\sec(x)$, and $\csc(x)$, and find their values for the 16 special angles shown on the unit circle. 
- Explain how the Quotient Rule is used to find the derivative of $\tan(x)$, $\cot(x)$, $\sec(x)$, and $\csc(x)$. 
- State the derivatives of $\tan(x)$, $\cot(x)$, $\sec(x)$, and $\csc(x)$.

**Advanced Learning Objectives:** *During and after* our class meeting, we will work on learning the following. Fluency with these is not required prior to class. 

-   Use derivative rules (including the Product and Quotient Rule, but also older rules) to solve problems about slopes, velocities, and rates of change involving basic functions.
-  Compute derivatives that involve a combination of all the rules we've learned up to this point. 


## Resources for learning

**Reading:** Read through [Section 2.4](https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-2-4-other-trig.html) of the _Active Calculus_ text. 

**Video:** Watch the following from the GVSUMath Calculus playlist:

## Exercises 

The exercises for this Daily Prep are found at student.desmos.com in "MTH 201 Daily Prep 5B". 


## Submission and grading 

To submit your work, simply submit the Google Form. You will receive a receipt via email to confirm your submission. (Look in your spam folders if you do not see the receipt.) 

A **Pass** mark is given if the Daily Prep is turned in before its deadline and if each item on the Daily Prep has a response that represents a good faith effort to be right. **Mistakes are not penalized**. A **No Pass** is given if an item is left blank (even accidentally), has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if the Daily Prep is late.
