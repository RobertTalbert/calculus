# Daily Prep 8B -- MTH 201-04

## Overview 

Having learned about the Extreme Value Theorem and how to use it to find absolute extreme values of a continuous function on a closed interval, we'll use Module 8B to put it to work on applied problems. The focus in this part of Module 8 is on *building the model first* and then using the Extreme Value Theorem to find its absolute extrema. 


## Learning objectives 

**Basic Learning Objectives:** *Before* our class meeting, use the Resources listed below to learn all of the following. You should be reasonably fluent with all of these tasks prior to our meeting; we will field questions on these, but they will not be retaught. 


+ (*Review*) State the **Extreme Value Theorem** and explain the three-step process it provides for finding the absolute extreme values of a continuous function on a closed interval. 

**Advanced Learning Objectives:** *During and after* our class meeting, we will work on learning the following. Fluency with these is not required prior to class. 

+ Given an applied setting, build a function that models the situation; identify a closed interval for its domain; then identify its absolute maximum and minimum values on the interval. 



## Resources for learning

**Reading:** In the _Active Calculus_ text, re-read part 3.3.2 "Moving Toward Applications" from [Section 3.3](https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-3-3-optimization.html). The exercises will focus on  Example 3.3.4 -- study it carefully and aim to understand each step of the process. 

**Video:** No new videos this time, although you might benefit from a quick review of the videos for Module 8A. 

## Exercises 

The exercises this time are on this Google Form, and notice when you get there that there is some background learning to be done about the concept of *revenue* and *price* from the business/economics world.

## Submission and grading 

To submit your work, simply submit the Google Form. You will receive a receipt via email to confirm your submission. (Look in your spam folders if you do not see the receipt.) 

A **Pass** mark is given if the Daily Prep is turned in before its deadline and if each item on the Daily Prep has a response that represents a good faith effort to be right. **Mistakes are not penalized**. A **No Pass** is given if an item is left blank (even accidentally), has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if the Daily Prep is late.
