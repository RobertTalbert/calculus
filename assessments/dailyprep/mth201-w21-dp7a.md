# Daily Prep 7A -- MTH 201-04

## Overview 

In Module 7, we start a deep dive into *applications of the derivative*. The first application is one that we've seen before --- finding peaks and troughs on the graph of a function. We can estimate these visually if we can see them; but since estimation is error-prone, we'd like a way to pinpoint the exact location of places where a function reaches a peak or a trough, and find *all* such locations, not just the ones that we see. We'll introduce the concept of the **critical number** of a function to help us, and then the **First** and **Second Derivative Tests** as tools for finding them.

## Learning objectives 

**Basic Learning Objectives:** *Before* our class meeting, use the Resources listed below to learn all of the following. You should be reasonably fluent with all of these tasks prior to our meeting; we will field questions on these, but they will not be retaught.

+ Identify the global and local minimum and maximum values of a function, given the function's graph.
+ State the definition of _critical number_ and identify all the critical numbers of a function given the function's graph.
+ State the First Derivative Test. 


**Advanced Learning Objectives:** *During and after* our class meeting, we will work on learning the following. Fluency with these is not required prior to class. 

+ Find all the critical numbers of a function algebraically using derivatives.
+ Use the First Derivative Test to determine whether a critical number of a function is a relative minimum, relative maximum, or neither.


## Resources for learning

**Reading:** In the _Active Calculus_ text, read in [Section 3.1](https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-3-1-tests.html) only up to, but _not_ including Example 3.1.10. (Module 7B will start with Example 3.1.10.) 

**Video:** Watch the following from the GVSUMath Calculus playlist. This is about 30 minutes of video altogether.

## Exercises 

The exercises for this Daily Prep are found on student.desmos.com. Look for "Module 7A Daily Prep". 


## Submission and grading 

To submit your work, simply submit the Google Form. You will receive a receipt via email to confirm your submission. (Look in your spam folders if you do not see the receipt.) 

A **Pass** mark is given if the Daily Prep is turned in before its deadline and if each item on the Daily Prep has a response that represents a good faith effort to be right. **Mistakes are not penalized**. A **No Pass** is given if an item is left blank (even accidentally), has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if the Daily Prep is late.
