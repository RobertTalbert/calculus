# Functions Bootcamp

## Overview

Calculus involves **functions** at every stage. Your prerequisite courses for MTH 201 have covered everything you need to know about functions --- but it's possible that your knowledge of functions might have decayed over time, or maybe you never felt fully confident about using functions when you learned about them first. Either way, the **Functions Bootcamp** is for you. 

The Functions Bootcamp is a set of **10 videos followed by a WeBWorK set**. Watching the videos and then doing the WeBWorK set will get your function knowledge completely up to where it needs to be, in order to move ahead into Calculus with confidence. It will remain available to you for the duration of the course in case you ever need to refresh your knowledge. 

One of your Core Learning Targets is the very first one: 

>- F.1 **(CORE)**: I can evaluate functions given in different representations, find composites of functions, and determine the domain and range of a function.
