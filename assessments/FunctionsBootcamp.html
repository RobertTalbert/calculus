<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Calculus involves <strong>functions</strong> at every stage. Your prerequisite courses for MTH 201 have covered everything you need to know about functions — but it’s possible that your knowledge of functions might have decayed over time, or maybe you never felt fully confident about using functions when you learned about them first. Either way, the <strong>Functions Bootcamp</strong> is for you.</p>
<p>The Functions Bootcamp is a set of <strong>10 videos and a WeBWorK set</strong>. Watching the videos and then doing the WeBWorK set will get your function knowledge completely up to where it needs to be, in order to move ahead into Calculus with confidence. It will remain available to you for the duration of the course in case you ever need to refresh your knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-functions-bootcamp-ties-into-the-course">How the Functions Bootcamp ties into the course</h2>
<p><strong>Completing the Functions Bootcamp assignment is the one and only way to satisfy Learning Target F.1:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>F.1 <strong>(CORE)</strong>: I can evaluate functions given in different representations, find composites of functions, and determine the domain and range of a function.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike the other Learning Targets, there will be no problems on Checkpoints for this target, and you won’t be able to do oral exams, videos, or use AEPs to satisfy it. The only way to check Learning Target F.1 is to complete the Functions Bootcamp WeBWorK assignment.</p>
<p>Your score on this assignment will determine your rating:</p>
<ul>
<li>A score of <strong>90% or higher</strong> will give you <strong>Mastery</strong> rating on Learning Target F.1;</li>
<li>A score of <strong>75% or higher, but less than 90%</strong>, will give you <strong>Proficiency</strong> rating on Learning Target F.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, Learning Target F.1 is the only target we have where you can achieve Mastery rating on the first try. Two “checks” are not needed if you score 90% or higher on the WeBWorK assignment.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>
<p>The WeBWorK assignment for the Functions Bootcamp is available now, and will remain open until <strong>11:59pm Eastern time on Sunday, September 20</strong>. Here is my recommended pathway to completing this assignment successfully:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>This week</strong>, go to WeBWorK and access the assignment. Set aside 1-2 hours to try to work through as many of the problems as you can without reviewing. Make a note of the concepts that are especially rusty for you.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>during week 2</strong>, budget time in your day to watch the videos for the Functions Bootcamp, especially those that have to do with the WeBWorK problems that gave you issues. And then try again. Remember you can redo any WeBWorK problem you want, as many times as you want, until the deadline.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 and 2, asking questions and seeking out targeted help as needed, until you have attained a 90% score or better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note, unlike regular WeBWorK sets, you may not spend a token to extend the deadline on this.</p>
<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>What if I don’t earn a 90% before the deadline?</strong> There will be a second version of the Functions Bootcamp assignment posted around the middle of the semester for those who didn’t get a high enough score the first time. <strong>But there will be no others,</strong> so really put effort into your work here.</p>
<p><strong>What if I only earn Proficiency rating and not Mastery?</strong> (I.e. what if my score was bigger than 75% but less than 90%?) You can try again on the second round later in the term; or if all you are wanting in the course is a C or a B you could simply stop and use Learning Target F.1 as one of your “Proficient but not Mastered” targets.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to watch the videos?</strong> No. If you feel your background is good enough to not need them, it’s fine to not watch them. Or, you can watch other videos; or use a textbook instead. The videos are just there to help.</p>
<p><strong>What are the academic honesty guidelines for this?</strong> Treat it like a Checkpoint. The syllabus says this about Checkpoint collaboration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No interactions at all with another person or with unauthorized sources on the internet is allowed. Any evidence of using information from another person or source will be investigated as academic dishonesty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>For this assignment, basic textbooks on high school algebra and precalculus along with videos from the web will be considered “authorized sources”.</em></p>
<p><strong>So, is there any help I can get on this?</strong> Of course! The videos are helpful, as are many other resources. And you can ask questions in drop-in hours as needed. Just stay away from other human interaction here.</p>
