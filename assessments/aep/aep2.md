# AEP 1: Data-driven rates of change 

## Overview 

In this AEP, you'll seek out data on a topic of interest to you, analyze the data and its first two derivatives, and think about what the information from the derivatives mean in context.

**Learning Targets associated with this AEP:**

+ D.2 **(CORE)**: I can use derivative notation correctly, state the units of a derivative, estimate the value of a derivative using difference quotients, and correctly interpret the meaning of a derivative in context.
+ D.3 **(CORE)**: Given information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$, I can correctly give information about $f$, $f'$, or $f''$ and the increasing/decreasing behavior and concavity of $f$ (and vice versa).

Remember, AEPs do not have fixed deadlines; simply work on this item until you are ready to submit it. But remember the **Two Items Per Week Rule.** 

## Technology Background


## AEP Description and Tasks 

### What this AEP is about

Data sets that involve two variables, and one of the variables is related to the other, are called *two-variable data sets*. An example of a two-variable data set is the US Census Bureau data used in AEP 1, in which the population of a city was given in terms of the year in which the data were collected. There is an implied relationship between one variable and the other. For example, in the population data, there is an implied relationship between time and population -- as time passes, population changes. Time is like the input variable to a function, and population is like the output; we call time the independent variable and population the dependent variable because population depends on time. Population also depends on a host of other variables (income levels, unemployment rates, cost of living, etc.) but in our data set, time is the independent variable we focus on.


Note that there is no explicit formula that perfectly describes this relationship --- if there were, we wouldn't need to collect census data! Instead, to tell the story of the data, we rely on two kinds of analysis techniques:

  

- *Numerical*, where we simply use the data themselves; and
-  *Graphical*, where we use regression techniques (discussed in AEP 1) to find an explicit function that provides a reasonable, but imperfect fit to the data and then use the formula.

For this AEP, you are going to go search up a two-variable data set on some topic that interests you and then analyze it --- tell its story --- using the concepts of the derivative and the numerical derivative approximation techniques we've studied.

### Setup (do this first) 

Think of a topic that interests you -- sports, politics, weather, etc, Then go to the internet and search for a two-variable data set that relates two quantities involved with that topic. You may use any kind of data you like as long as:

 
- It *doesn't involve populations and time*, because this is the subject of AEP 1.
- The set involves *only two variables*, and there are *at least five pairs of data in the set*.
- The data set is *real* (not made up by you) and you can *provide a link to the source*.
- The data set has *some kind of personal relevance to you, that you can explain.* You are especially encouraged to look for data that relate to your academic major in some way.
  

For example, I (Prof. Talbert) like to cook, so I began to wonder how the prices of some of the ingredients I use have changed over time. Doing a Google search on "price of a pound of ground beef over time" led me to this site, which shows the price in US dollars of a pound of beef in each year from 1995 to 2017. (Here the independent variable is time in years, and the dependent variable is price in US dollars.)

### Tasks for this AEP


## Assignment Expectations and Grading Criteria 

AEPs are graded using the "EMRN" rubric found in the syllabus. **A grade of E or M requires all of the following to be met:**


## Submitting your work 

**AEP submissions must be typewritten and saved as either a PDF or MS Word file. No part of your submission may involve handwriting; work that is submitted that contains handwriting will be graded N and returned without feedback.** This includes electronic handwritten docments, for example using a stylus and a note-taking app. To type up your work, you can use MS Word or Google Docs (both of which have equation editors for mathematical notation) or any other computer-based math typesetting tool. Just make sure you save your work as a Word document or PDF (no `.odt`, `.rtf`, or other file extensions are allowed).

When you have your work typed up, double-check it for neatness, correctness, and clarity. Then, go to Blackboard, then **Assignments**, then **AEP**, then **AEP 1**. Clicking on the text "AEP 1" will take you to a place on Blackboard where you can upload your work. All grading and revisions of labs are done entirely on Blackboard. **Do not email your work to the professor** -- only Blackboard submissions are accepted.

## Getting Help

Please note that according to the syllabus, for AEP's **"no interactions at all with another person or with unauthorized sources on the internet is allowed."** Violations of this rule include *any* consultation with other students or former students, including Math Center tutors; using work from another student or former student; submitting the problem set to an online help site such as Chegg or Coursehero; or asking for help in an online forum. All such violations will be treated as academic dishonesty and will result in a grade of "N" and being banned from revising the work. 

You **may** ask me (Talbert) for help on this assignment in the form of **specific mathematical or technical questions**. If I cannot answer a question because it would give too much away, I'll tell you so. **However please note: I will not "look over your work" before you submit it to give you feedback on the overall submission**; the expectations are clearly laid out above, so just follow those directions and submit your best work, and you'll be allowed to revise it if needed. 
 
**You can ask technology related questions to anyone at any time**. For example if you need help with Desmos, or with figuring out how to type up your work, there are no restrictions on that. I recommend the `#tech` channel on Campuswire so that you'll reach a large audience.
