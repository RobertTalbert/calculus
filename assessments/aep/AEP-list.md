# UPDATED AEP list 2020-09-29

1. *Data driven rates of change* 
2. *Derivatives and real-world data* (still without shortcuts)
3. *Local linearizations*
4. *Continuity and differentiability* 
5. Revisiting AEP 2 but with shortcut rules this time
6. L'Hopital's Rule 
7. Families of functions
8. Optimization
9. Total change 


# Planned Application/Extension Problems for MTH 201 Fall 2020

+ Derivatives with technology (Module 2) 
  + Given some functions -- find values of the derivative with limits, and then with Desmos. Same with formulas
+ Instantaneous ROC (Module 3) 
  + Find data, model it, then get estimates on rates of change
+ Limits, Continuity, Differentiabiity (Module 3)
  + Graph piecewise functions and determine limits, continuity, differentiability; construct functions with specified info
+ Derivatives of a real model (Module 4)
  + Take the model from the IROC AEP and find derivatives using tech and estimation 
+ L'Hopital's Rule (Module 6)
+ Newton's Method (Module 6)
+ Families of Functions (Module 7) 
  + 1- and 2-parameter families 
+ Optimization (Module 8)
  + Choice of optimization problems
+ Implicit differentiation/tangent lines (Module 9)
  + Draw something cool with an implicit function then put some tangent lines on it 
+ Total Change (Module 11)


## Thoughts on this

- Have all 10 posted on Day 1 
- Some are required? L'Hopital's Rule, Derivatives with Tech. 
- Deadlines: 
  - Quota/Single Deadline
  - Incentives: EC/tokens for completing on a timeline 
  - Required ones expire after a certain time to ensure they get done early 
- Post more as you get more ideas
