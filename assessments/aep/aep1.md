# AEP 1: Data-driven rates of change 

## Overview 

In this AEP, you will use technological tools to work with sets of data and build models of real-world quantitative phenomena, then apply what you've learned to determine average and instantaneous rates of change.

**Learning Targets associated with this AEP:**

+ F.1: I can find the average rate of change of a function on an interval.
+ D.1 **(CORE)**: I can find the derivative of a function, both at a point and as a function, using the definition of the derivative.
+ D.2 **(CORE)**: I can use derivative notation correctly, state the units of a derivative, estimate the value of a derivative using difference quotients, and correctly interpret the meaning of a derivative in context.

Remember, AEPs do not have fixed deadlines; simply work on this item until you are ready to submit it. But remember the **Two Items Per Week Rule.** 

## Technology Background

Before you begin this AEP, you will need to get comfortable with two

tasks using the Desmos online graphing tool: **graphing functions** and doing **regression analysis**. *Regression* refers to the process of approximating a collection of data with a function and then using the function to draw conclusions about the data.

Desmos can be accessed at `http://desmos.com`, or by going to Blackboard and clicking on **Course technology** and then **Desmos graphing tool**. There's also an app for mobile devices.

Please do the following before attempting this Lab:

  

- If you are not already familiar with graphing functions in Desmos, go to Blackboard and then **Course technology**, then **Desmos tutorials** and watch the three short videos that are there.
- Work through this short lesson on regression:
<https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/regression>. The "Scatter plots" portion of the lesson (which is the first grouping of videos and exerises) is really all you need, but you are welcome

to work through the rest of the lesson as well. If you are already

familiar with the concept of regression, you can just skim this

section.

  

- Now learn how to use Desmos to construct regressions by accessing

the interactive web page at

<https://www.desmos.com/calculator?tour=regressions>.

  

- Once you have worked through the regressions tour, you can watch a

video on using Desmos to do regressions at
