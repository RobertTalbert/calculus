# AEP 1: Rates of change from data


## What this AEP is about 

In this AEP, you will use technological tools to work with sets of data and build models of economic or health data, then apply what you've learned to determine average and instantaneous rates of change.

## Prerequisites and tech requirements 

You will be ready to begin this AEP following **Module 1.** 

**Technology used in this AEP:** 

+ [Desmos](http://desmos.com) to graph data points. You've seen how to graph formulas with Desmos, but you can also graph tables of data. Here is a tutorial: https://learn.desmos.com/tables Many more tutorials are available via a web search. 
+ [Desmos](http://desmos.com) to plot **regressions**. A *regression* is a function constructed to be the "best fit" through a plot of points. A basic explanation of what a regression is, is found here: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/regression And a brief tutorial on how to construct regressions in Desmos is given here: https://learn.desmos.com/regressions Again, many more tutorials and examples can be found via a web search. 

**Several future AEPs will involve using Desmos to plot data and build regression formulas** so learning these tasks now will pay off considerably later on. 


## Background and setup

## Grading criteria and submission instructions

Please refer to the [overall quality standards for AEPs](https://hackmd.io/@rtalbert235/HkSbMs2Av) at the link (and posted to the *AEPs* area on Blackboard) first, and make sure your work meets all these criteria. In addition to the overall standards, this AEP has the following specific standards: 



| Mark: | Criteria:  |
| -------- | --------  |
| **E** (Excellent)     | Text          |
| **M** (Meets Expectations) | Text   | 

Please [see the syllabus](https://hackmd.io/@rtalbert235/SJ5fDZIAv#How-are-individual-assignments-graded) for how grades of **P** (Progressing) and **X** (Not Assessable) are assigned. 


To submit this AEP: 

- Create a **typed document** using a word processor utilizing an equation editor for any significant mathematical notation. **Submissions that are handwritten or contain any handwritten work without prior permission will be graded "X" and returned without comment.** 
- Save the document as a PDF. Please **do not submit Word (.doc, .docx) or Open Office (.odt) files** as these do not always render mathematical notation correctly on screen. 
- Upload the PDF to the appropriate AEP assignment in the *AEPs* area on Blackboard. **Remember to hit the "Submit" button after uploading**, otherwise your work is merely on the Blackboard server and not in the instructor's grading queue. 

Once graded, the grade (E, M, P, X) will appear in your gradebook. You can then open the submission to view feedback left by the professor. These appear as text comments on the page or as general comments next to the grade. Grades of E or M may not have much feedback. Grades of P or X *always* have feedback, so please look carefully for this. 

For information on revisions of AEPs, please [consult the syllabus](https://hackmd.io/@rtalbert235/SJ5fDZIAv#How-do-I-revise-and-resubmit-my-work).
