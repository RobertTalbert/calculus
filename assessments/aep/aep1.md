# AEP 1: Data-driven rates of change 

## Overview 

In this AEP, you will use technological tools to work with sets of data and build models of real-world quantitative phenomena, then apply what you've learned to determine average and instantaneous rates of change.

**Learning Targets associated with this AEP:**

+ F.1: I can find the average rate of change of a function on an interval.
+ D.1 **(CORE)**: I can find the derivative of a function, both at a point and as a function, using the definition of the derivative.
+ D.2 \tetxbf{(CORE)}: I can use derivative notation correctly, state the units of a derivative, estimate the value of a derivative using difference quotients, and correctly interpret the meaning of a derivative in context.
