# AEP 8: Applied Optimization

## Overview

This AEP continues and completes our class work on applied optimization.  

**Learning Targets associated with this AEP:**

-  **DA.4**  **(CORE)**: I can set up and use derivatives to solve applied optimization problems.

## Technology Background

No special background needed apart from using Desmos in the usual ways. 

## AEP Description and Tasks

## What this AEP is about

This AEP is simply continued practice and experience with setting up and solving applied optimization problems. There's not much else to say about this other than what we've already discussed in class. However, this AEP will ask you to be quite thorough in your solutions, moreso than we are in class typically. To help you with this, there are two resources available: 

First, there's this flowchart for doing applied optimization. Following the steps in the flowchart will help you avoid skipping steps and leaving out information. A full-size version of this is posted where this AEP assignment is posted. 

Second, here's a sample solution that would earn an "E" grade under the grading standards at the end of this document. Study it and use it as a model for what

### Tasks for this AEP

**Note: While not required, you can use spreadsheets to organize or do calculations your data. If you do, please read carefully the guidelines for spreadsheets given in the next section.** 

1. Choose a gender (boy or girl) and a physical attribute (length or weight). For the gender and attribute you chose, take the data for the 50th percentile and construct tables for the first derivative and the second derivative of those data. Show your work on at least one calculation for each derivative and give a one-sentence summary of what you did. (You may also use a spreadsheet to do these calculations, if you know how.) Put your results either in your writeup, or in a separate Google Sheet. 
2. In 3-4 complete and well-constructed sentences, explain what the derivative and second derivative data tell you about the way that the physical attribute you chose is changing as the child ages. You might use terms like "decreasing at an increasing rate" to do this; be as detailed as you can (but keep it brief) and explain why your derivative and second derivative data back up your claim. 
3. Keeping the same gender and physical attribute, put your data into a Desmos table with age in the $x_1$ column and the attribute data in the other. Adjust the viewing window until it's appropriately sized (that is, you can see all the data and there is minimal "dead space" with nothing in it). **Pro tip: Copying and pasting data from the spreadsheet into Desmos makes the table and plots the data on a nice window automatically.** There's nothing to turn in for this part; it's just a setup for the next part.
4. The data from the CDC chart has a particular shape that is well-suited for *logarithmic functions*. (Here's a graph of the basic $y = \ln(x)$ function: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/apy9ucb8ft Notice how it looks like the CDC graphs!) So use Desmos to find a **logarithmic regression** for the data you plotted. To do so, if your data are entered into Desmos in the column labelled $x_1$, the in a blank cell enter: 

$$y_1 \sim a \ln(bx_1 + c) + d$$

Just as in earlier AEPs where we did regressions with other kinds of functions, this will give you numerical values for the parameters $a,b,c$ and $d$ that produce a "logarithmic curve of best fit". For example, the data in this graph are being fit with the function $y = 5.43655 \ln(0.486967x + 1.60832) + 1.66321$:

When you've done your logarithmic regression, copy a link to the Desmos worksheet (not the image, but a link to the entire worksheet) and include this in your writeup along with the formula for the logarithmic function that was created. 

5. Using our methods from Chapter 2, find the first derivative of your model. Show all your work and give a 1-2 sentence explanation of your work (for example if you use the Chain Rule, state how you decomposed the function). 

6. The data in the CDC charts ends at 36 months. But we can use the derivative to make predictions for data not on the charts. Using the results of your work in the previous step, predict the value of the physical attribute you chose (length or weight) for a child who is 4 years old. Show your work and explain in 1-2 complete sentences what you did. 


## Assignment Expectations and Grading Criteria 

**Guidelines for using spreadsheets:** The use of spreadsheets is not required on this AEP (other than reading data off of the one that's provided), but you are also free to use spreadsheets to organize your data or make computations with it. There are many  extremely good YouTube tutorials available for basic spreadsheet use if you need to refresh yourself on how to use a spreadsheet for making data computations, or if you're starting from zero and want to take this opportunity to pick up a useful new skill. **If you use a spreadsheet**, please abide by these rules: 

- **Use Google Sheets only.** If you are an Excel person, you can import an Excel sheet into Google Sheets. But we use Google Sheets since they are much easier to share. 
- **Change the permissions on your Google Sheet** so that *Anyone with the link* has access, and the access is *Editor* not "Viewer". You can do this by clicking the green "Share" button in the upper right. **I can't grade your work until I have this level of permissions.** 
- **In your writeup** (which, remember, should be 100% typed) **include a link to your Google Sheet**. 

Now for the rest of the guidelines: 

AEPs are graded using the "EMRN" rubric found in the syllabus. Please note, it is the case with all AEP's that **your grade is primarily based on your explanations and writing, and only secondarily on the precision and correctness of your computations.** Correct computations with insufficient explanation will need to be revised and may receive an "N" grade. 

Also, **significant incompleteness will result in a grade of "N".** This includes the following: 

- **Giving answers with no explanations.** As mentioned above, you are being graded on explanations and writing, not so much on answers. Submissions that contain items where there is an answer with no explanation or insufficient explanation, will be graded "N" and returned without comment.
- Leaving items blank (even accidentally)
- Leaving large gaps in computations (skipping important steps) 
- Giving only partial attempts at tasks (for example, working down to a certain point in a solution and then stopping because you need help) 



**A grade of E or M requires all of the following to be met:**

- All the links you provide work --- including the link to your spreadsheet, if you use one. 
- All your derivative calculations (both the numerical and the algebraic) must be correct. There are tools available to check your work; use them. 
- All work needs to be shown *and* your thought processes clearly expressed in all of the tasks of the assignment. 
- All the information needed for an "outsider" to understand your work needs to be self-contained within the work. **The reader should not have to do any work to fill in gaps.** 
- Explanations must be given in clearly written and grammatically correct English. Multiple instances of failure to capitalize beginnings of sentences, subject-verb agreement, misuse of punctuation, etc. will result in a grade of R or N. 
- Some simple mistakes in calculations are allowed, but significant errors and those that lead to incorrect explanations will probably result in a grade or R or N. 


There are some additional formatting requirements in the "Submitting your work" section below. 


A grade of "E" is given if all of the above expectations are met, and the work is of superior quality in terms of the clarity of explanations and work, appearance of the writeup, and precision of the mathematics. 



## Submitting your work 

**AEP submissions must be typewritten and saved as either a PDF or MS Word file. No part of your submission may involve handwriting; work that is submitted that contains handwriting will be graded N and returned without feedback.** This includes electronic handwritten documents, for example using a stylus and a note-taking app. To type up your work, you can use MS Word or Google Docs (both of which have equation editors for mathematical notation) or any other computer-based math typesetting tool. Just make sure you save your work as a Word document or PDF (no `.odt`, `.rtf`, or other file extensions are allowed).

When you have your work typed up, double-check it for neatness, correctness, and clarity. Then, go to Blackboard, then **Assignments**, then **AEP**, then **AEP 7**. Clicking on the text "AEP 7" will take you to a place on Blackboard where you can upload your work. All grading and revisions of labs are done entirely on Blackboard. **Do not email your work to the professor** -- only Blackboard submissions are accepted.

## Getting Help

Please note that according to the syllabus, for AEP's **"no interactions at all with another person or with unauthorized sources on the internet is allowed."** Violations of this rule include *any* consultation with other students or former students, including Math Center tutors; using work from another student or former student; submitting the problem set to an online help site such as Chegg or Coursehero; or asking for help in an online forum. All such violations will be treated as academic dishonesty and will result in a grade of "N" and being banned from revising the work. 

You **may** ask me (Talbert) for help on this assignment in the form of **specific mathematical or technical questions**. If I cannot answer a question because it would give too much away, I'll tell you so. **However please note: I will not "look over your work" before you submit it to give you feedback on the overall submission**; the expectations are clearly laid out above, so just follow those directions and submit your best work, and you'll be allowed to revise it if needed. 
 
**You can ask technology related questions to anyone at any time**. For example if you need help with Desmos, or with figuring out how to type up your work, there are no restrictions on that. I recommend the `#tech` channel on Campuswire so that you'll reach a large audience.
